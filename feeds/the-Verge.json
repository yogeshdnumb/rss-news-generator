It criminalizes the publication of nonconsensual intimate images (NCII), whether real or computer-generated, and requires social media platforms to have a system to remove those images within 48 hours of being flagged. In his address to Congress this year, Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/us/politics/transcript-trump-speech-congress.html\">quipped that once he signed it</a>, “I’m going to use that bill for myself too, if you don’t mind, because nobody gets treated worse than I do online, nobody.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The proliferation of AI tools that make it easier than ever to generate realistic-looking images has supercharged concerns about deepfaked, damaging content <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/technology/deepfake-ai-nudes-westfield-high-school.html\">spreading through schools</a> and creating a new vector of bullying and abuse. But while critics say that’s an important issue to deal with, they worry that the Take It Down Act’s approach could be exploited to inflict harm in other ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), which was created to combat image-based sexual abuse, said that it can’t cheer the Take It Down Act’s passage. “While we welcome the long-overdue federal criminalization of NDII [the nonconsensual distribution of intimate images], we regret that it is combined with a takedown provision that is highly susceptible to misuse and will likely be counter-productive for victims,” the group writes. It fears that the bill, which empowers the Federal Trade Commission — whose Democratic minority commissioners Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/632267/democratic-ftc-commissioners-alvaro-bedoya-rebecca-kelly-slaughter-illegally-fired-trump\">fired in a break with decades of&nbsp; Supreme Court precedent</a> —&nbsp; will be selectively enforced in a way that ultimately only props up “unscrupulous platforms.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Platforms that feel confident that they are unlikely to be targeted by the FTC (for example, platforms that are closely aligned with the current administration) may feel emboldened to&nbsp; simply ignore reports of NDII,” they write. “Platforms attempting to identify authentic complaints may encounter a sea of false reports that could overwhelm their efforts and jeopardize their ability to operate at all.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Platforms may respond by abandoning encryption entirely”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Because of the quick turnaround for platforms to remove content flagged as nonconsensual intimate imagery, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/02/take-it-down-act-flawed-attempt-protect-victims-will-lead-censorship\">warns that especially smaller platforms</a> “will have to comply so quickly to avoid legal risk that they won’t be able to verify claims.” Instead, they’ll likely turn to flawed filters to crack down on duplicates, they write. The group also cautions that end-to-end encrypted services including private messaging systems and cloud storage are not exempted from the bill, posing a risk to the privacy technology. Since encrypted services can’t monitor what their users send to one another, the EFF asks, “How could such services comply with the takedown requests mandated in this bill? Platforms may respond by abandoning encryption entirely in order to be able to monitor content—turning private conversations into surveilled spaces,” including ones that abuse survivors commonly turn to.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even so, the Take It Down Act quickly garnered a wide base of support. First Lady Melania Trump has become a leading champion of the bill, but it’s also seen backing from parent and youth advocates, as well as some in the tech industry. Google’s president of global affairs Kent Walker <a href=\"https://x.com/Kent_Walker/status/1917010533821370436\">called the passage</a> “a big step toward protecting individuals from nonconsensual explicit imagery,” and Snap <a href=\"https://x.com/Snap/status/1917011319112323379\">similarly applauded the vote</a>. Internet Works, a group whose members include medium-sized companies like Discord, Etsy, Reddit, Roblox, and others, praised the House vote, with executive director Peter Chandler saying the bill “would empower victims to remove NCII materials from the Internet and end the cycle of victimization by those who publish this heinous content.”<br>Rep.

It fears that the bill, which empowers the Federal Trade Commission — whose Democratic minority commissioners Trump fired in a break with decades of  Supreme Court precedent —  will be selectively enforced in a way that ultimately only props up “unscrupulous platforms.”\n“Platforms that feel confident that they are unlikely to be targeted by the FTC (for example, platforms that are closely aligned with the current administration) may feel emboldened to  simply ignore reports of NDII,” they write. “Platforms attempting to identify authentic complaints may encounter a sea of false reports that could overwhelm their efforts and jeopardize their ability to operate at all.”\n\n“Platforms may respond by abandoning encryption entirely”\n\n\nBecause of the quick turnaround for platforms to remove content flagged as nonconsensual intimate imagery, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) warns that especially smaller platforms “will have to comply so quickly to avoid legal risk that they won’t be able to verify claims.” Instead, they’ll likely turn to flawed filters to crack down on duplicates, they write. The group also cautions that end-to-end encrypted services including private messaging systems and cloud storage are not exempted from the bill, posing a risk to the privacy technology. Since encrypted services can’t monitor what their users send to one another, the EFF asks, “How could such services comply with the takedown requests mandated in this bill? Platforms may respond by abandoning encryption entirely in order to be able to monitor content—turning private conversations into surveilled spaces,” including ones that abuse survivors commonly turn to.\nEven so, the Take It Down Act quickly garnered a wide base of support. First Lady Melania Trump has become a leading champion of the bill, but it’s also seen backing from parent and youth advocates, as well as some in the tech industry. Google’s president of global affairs Kent Walker called the passage “a big step toward protecting individuals from nonconsensual explicit imagery,” and Snap similarly applauded the vote. Internet Works, a group whose members include medium-sized companies like Discord, Etsy, Reddit, Roblox, and others, praised the House vote, with executive director Peter Chandler saying the bill “would empower victims to remove NCII materials from the Internet and end the cycle of victimization by those who publish this heinous content.”\nRep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), one of two members (both Republican) who voted against the bill, wrote on X that he couldn’t support it because “I feel this is a slippery slope, ripe for abuse, with unintended consequences.”","summary":"The Take It Down Act is heading to President Donald Trump’s desk after the House voted 409-2 to pass the bill, which will require social media companies to take down content flagged as nonconsensual (including AI-generated) sexual images. Trump has pledged to sign it. The bill is among the only pieces of online safety legislation [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/?p=657632","isoDate":"2025-04-29T01:03:07.000Z"},{"title":"Duolingo will replace contract workers with AI","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/657594/duolingo-ai-first-replace-contract-workers","pubDate":"2025-04-28T23:47:03.000Z","author":"Jay Peters","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn. | Photo: Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Getty Images\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/gettyimages-1543231785.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption>Duolingo co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn. | Photo: Getty Images</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Duolingo will “gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle,” according to an all-hands email sent by co-founder and CEO Luis von Ahn announcing that the company will be “AI-first.” The email was posted on <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322560534824865792/\">Duolingo’s LinkedIn account</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to von Ahn, being “AI-first” means the company will “need to rethink much of how we work” and that “making minor tweaks to systems designed for humans won’t get us there.” As part of the shift, the company will roll out “a few constructive constraints,” including the changes to how it works with contractors, looking for AI use in hiring and in performance reviews, and that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">von Ahn says that “Duolingo will remain a company that cares deeply about its employees” and that “this isn’t about replacing Duos with AI.” Instead, he says that the changes are “about removing bottlenecks” so that employees can “focus on creative work and real problems, not repetitive tasks.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“AI isn’t just a productivity boost,” von Ahn says. “It helps us get closer to our mission.
