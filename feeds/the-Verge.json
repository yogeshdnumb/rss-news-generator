actions, including halting enforcement of the TikTok ban and rolling back the Biden administration’s artificial intelligence order.\nHaving already run the country once before, Trump entered the presidency with the goal of hitting the ground running, having already selected nominees and chairs for key agencies that oversee tech. This time, Trump has the backing of many tech billionaires who attended his inauguration and showed up at his home in Mar-a-Lago.\nRead on below as we keep track of all the ways Trump is leaving his mark on tech in his first 100 days in office.\nA US agency has been told to stop its election security work.\n\t\t\t\nTrump admin pulls hundreds of videos from CFPB’s YouTube channel\n\t\t\t\nJudge temporarily blocks mass firings at CFPB.\n\t\t\t\nThree different court hearings over DOGE just today.\n\t\t\t\nTrump administration adds anti-trans notices to restored websites\n\t\t\t\nClimate group that called for ‘free Palestine’ stripped of federal funding\n\t\t\t\nTreasury inspector general will investigate DOGE payments access\n\t\t\t\nSmall businesses are already feeling Trump’s tariffs\n\t\t\t\nThe technology team at financial regulator CFPB has been gutted\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk’s DOGE website has been defaced because anyone can edit it\n\t\t\t\nTrump administration ordered to temporarily unfreeze foreign aid funds.\n\t\t\t\n“Trump’s share of a $10 million settlement Elon Musk’s X agreed to this week is expected to go to him directly.”\n\t\t\t\nWhat’s with the EPA seizing ‘gold bars’?\n\t\t\t\nState Dept.’s plan to buy $400 million worth of armored Teslas hastily changed to ‘armored EVs’\n\t\t\t\nFederal workers say they increasingly distrust platforms like Facebook\n\t\t\t\nTrump’s January 6th Twitter lawsuit settled for ‘about $10 million’\n\t\t\t\nWaste.gov locks down after people discover it’s just a WordPress template\n\t\t\t\nNHTSA censors car

Apple’s entry-level tablet uses an A14 Bionic chipset and offers a 10.9-inch display that’s roomy enough for almost any task you can carry out on it. Although you might want a higher-end model for 4K editing and heavier workloads, the entry-level iPad is great for almost any other moderate need, including browsing, streaming, and doodling (it’s compatible with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-1st-Generation-Adapter/dp/B0BJLG69QR/\">first-gen Apple Pencil</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MUWA3AM-A-Pencil-USB-C/dp/B0CL7J12YK\">newer USB-C model</a>). It can even handle some light gaming. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can grab a four-pack of<strong> AirTags</strong> for $69.99 ($30 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-pack-dp-B0D54JZTHY/dp/B0D54JZTHY\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/g0x1unqu0r24j\">Best Buy</a> right now, which matches the bundle’s best price to date. Apple’s ultra wideband trackers are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23769840/best-bluetooth-trackers\">our No. 1 pick for iPhone users</a>, as they allow you to track your keys, bag, and other belongings within inches of their location using Apple’s extensive Find My network. They also feature replaceable batteries, carry an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and offer tracking alerts to help prevent stalking. Hell, you can even now share their location with a handful of airlines, courtesy of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319503/apple-airtag-find-my-network-share-item-location-united-airlines-lost-bag-luggage\">recent iOS 18 update</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety\">Read our original review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>13-inch M2 MacBook Air</strong> with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD is down to $749 ($250 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLHT9VXW\">Amazon</a> (at checkout) or $799 at <a href=\"https://howl.link/mutbgspkigi5m\">Best Buy</a>. The last-gen Air is still a great laptop for most people, especially now that it starts with 16GB of RAM. That gives it enough memory to handle macOS Sequoia’s AI-based Apple Intelligence features, along with enough power for light video, photo, and audio work. It’s also noticeably lighter than the MacBook Pro, yet it still lasts all day thanks to the efficiency of Apple’s M2 chip.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-headphone-and-earbud-deals\">The best headphone and earbud deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Sony’s <strong>WH-1000XM4</strong> are available for around $248 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-Phone-Call/dp/B08MVGF24M/ref=asc_df_B08MVGF24M?mcid=bbb56d1244eb35f1b031b79790d70995&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=693364628076&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11061898993576390024&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9026954&amp;hvtargid=pla-1056322592620&amp;th=1\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/iuzeaobcf4d3u\">Best Buy</a>. The last-gen pair of headphones remain a solid alternative to the XM5 thanks to their fantastic noise cancellation and overall call quality. They last up to 30 hours per charge, support Google Fast Pair and Find My on Android devices, and feature multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. They also support 360-degree spatial audio and, unlike the latest model, tout a foldable design that’s far more portable. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong>Bose QuietComfort Headphones</strong> are down to $249 ($100 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/3tuqh4ip2kcbl\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bose.com/p/noise-cancelling-headphones/quietcomfort-acoustic-noise-cancelling-headphones/QC-HEADPHONEARN.html\">Bose’s online storefront</a>. The midrange headphones are the spiritual successor to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22698629/bose-quietcomfort-qc-45-headphones-review\">Bose QuietComfort 45</a>, offering similar audio quality but more granular control over ANC and ambient passthrough levels.

They’re a solid pair of wireless earbuds if you want to enjoy music without completely plugging your ear canals. Unlike bone-conduction headphones, which send vibrations through your skull for similar open-ear benefits, the Open Earbuds clip onto your ear lobe. Bose’s so-called OpenAudio technology then directs audio toward your eardrums. They’re an interesting alternative that might be more ideal for workouts than other products, but by nature, they don’t perform as well as traditional earbuds. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24073019/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Now through February 17th, <strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sport X10&nbsp;</strong>are on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) — just $5 shy of their all-time low — <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/itm/334481497412\">when you buy them from Anker’s eBay storefront</a> and use offer code <strong>PREZ20</strong> at checkout. Despite being an older model, the Sport X10 remain a great pair of budget-friendly workout earbuds with flexible ear hooks, a robust IPX7 rating for water and sweat resistance, and powerful bass. They’re certainly not on par with something like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/headphone-review/609473/powerbeats-pro-2-review-headphones-heart-rate-monitoring-wearables\">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>, but they’re a solid gym pick for the price.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-speaker-deals\">Best speaker deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can get the <strong>Bose SoundLink Flex (second-gen)</strong> for $129 ($20 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0D6WD2QSQ\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/ukirwa2spkwrp\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bose.com/p/speakers/bose-soundlink-flex-portable-speaker-2nd-gen/SLFLXII-SPEAKERWIRELESS.html\">Bose</a>, which is about $12 more than its lowest price to date. The portable Bluetooth speaker is water and dust-resistant, said to be rugged enough to withstand drops, lasts up to 12 hours per charge, and allows you to pair it with another for stereo playback. Its flat profile makes it easy to slip into a bag, but you can also use the integrated strap to attach it using a carabiner or other means.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can buy a standalone <strong>Echo Pop</strong> for $29.99 ($10 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/dp/B09ZXLRRHY/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/f8mupo8svoi29\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo-pop-1st-gen-2023-release-full-sound-compact-smart-speaker-with-alexa-charcoal/-/A-88440368\">Target</a>, or pick it up with a heart-themed faceplate and sleeve for $40.98 ($23 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Pop-Bundle-Charcoal-Faceplate/dp/B0CQZHFJKQ\">Amazon</a>. That’s nowhere near the lowest price we’ve seen on either configuration — we’ve seen it drop to $18 in the past — but it is the first time Amazon’s entry-level smart speaker has gone on sale since the holidays. It delivers good sound for its size, doubles as an Eero mesh Wi-Fi extender, and offers a lot of Alexa-based smarts, allowing you to control various smart devices with your voice, check sports scores, set alarms, and more. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23742395/amazon-echo-pop-smart-speaker-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-smart-home-deals\">The best smart home deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You can grab a <strong>Blink Outdoor 4</strong> with a Sync Module 2 for $69.99 ($30 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-4th-Gen-1-Camera/dp/B0B1N5HW22\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/5rjkedippygkm\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.homedepot.com/p/Blink-Outdoor-4-4th-Gen-Wireless-Outdoor-Smart-Home-Security-Camera-System-with-1-Camera-up-to-2-Year-Battery-Life-Black-B0B1N5HW22/326889079\">The Home Depot</a>. That’s not as good as the bundle’s previous price tag of $40, but it’s still decent for a wireless security camera that can work in the elements. The 1080p camera offers all the essentials needed to monitor areas inside or outside your home, including night vision, two-way video, and motion detection support with person detection (if you pay the $3 monthly fee). It builds on its predecessor with a broader field of view, too, so you can see more of its coverage area.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Amazon’s&nbsp;latest <strong>Echo Show 5</strong> is on sale for $69.99 ($20 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B2SBHQK\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/nhp3q7d8upqsa\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://howl.link/nhp3q7d8upqsa\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo-show-5-3rd-gen-2023-release-smart-display-with-deeper-bass-and-clearer-sound-glacier-white/-/A-88440367\">Target</a>, which is its third-best price to date. The smart display offers better sound and mics than its predecessor while retaining its small, 5.5-inch footprint, which makes it a great bedside alarm clock. As an Alexa-enabled smart display, you can also use it to control other smart home devices with your voice, like your lights.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/5/24091220/mill-smart-kitchen-trash-can-second-generation-price-specs\"><strong>Mill Food Recycler</strong></a> is on sale for $874 ($125 off) directly <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mill.com%2Forder-now\">from Mill</a>, which is one of its best prices to date. The smart trash can is designed to grind food scraps and convert them into chicken food, which you can then either ship to Washington state or use yourself. The latest model can process 40 pounds of leftovers and is slightly faster than the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23828379/mill-kitchen-trash-can-bin-review\">first-gen iteration we tested</a>, too, allowing you to create a coffee ground-like substance in two and a half hours as opposed to 10.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-gaming-deals\">The best gaming deals</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><em>NBA 2K25</em></strong> is down to $24.99 ($45 off) — an all-time low — at Amazon for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K25-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D96QNZWH\">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K25-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D96RBDVX\">Xbox Series X / S</a> (you can also get it for $19.99 for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/NBA-2K25-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D96R4N9R\">Nintendo Switch</a>). The current promo on the basketball simulator comes just in time for the NBA all-star weekend. It’s updated within days of the league-wide roster changes, with realistic lineups reflected across Play Now and GM modes. You can also build a fantasy squad through MyTeam’s collectible card experience, or create a MyPlayer character to act out your own rags to riches story in the NBA.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>49-inch Odyssey G95SD OLED</strong> is available for $1,499.99 ($400 off) from <a href=\"https://howl.link/q3as36f3ox8in\">Samsung’s online store</a>. That’s a record-low price on Samsung’s newest G9 monitor, though you can get the similarly impressive G95SC from 2023 for $1,014.02 (about $786 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-Adjustable-LS49CG932SNXZA/dp/B0CDQMQQS2\">Amazon</a>. The QHD-equivalent, ultra-wide curved OLED monitors sport a 240Hz refresh rate and a .03-millisecond response time. The glare-free panel should make it a blast for playing games in most lighting conditions, while adaptive brightness tech detects static on-screen elements and lowers the local brightness to protect the display from burn-in. Both models also feature an RGB ring on the rear that can change dynamically based on what’s happening in your game.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can get the <strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938589/samsung-55-inch-odyssey-ark-2nd-gen-g97nc-gaming-monitor-price-release-date-specs-features\">55-inch Samsung Odyssey Ark (second-gen)</a></strong> for $1,799.99 ($900 off) at <a href=\"https://howl.link/mvlhzr1tudvel\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1719328-REG/samsung_odyssey_ark_55_4k.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and direct from <a href=\"https://howl.link/hemaqv9x92adu\">Samsung</a>. It’s an absolutely unhinged 4K Mini-LED curved display that supports up to 165Hz refresh rate, and you can flip it vertically into “cockpit” mode for a new perspective while gaming or for whatever hardcore productivity needs you might have. Also aiding your productivity is an improved Multi View feature that lets you view up to four independent HDMI or DisplayPort sources simultaneously.

Thankfully, if you’re looking to get ahead, Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers are already discounting plenty of tech, including some of the items we fawn over at The Verge.\nRight now, for instance, Apple devices like the second-gen AirPods Pro and Apple Watch Series 10 are seeing some of their best prices to date. You can also find discounts on terrific noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s WH-1000XM5, smart home devices like the Blink Mini 2 security camera, Amazon devices like the newest Kindle Paperwhite, and more. We’re updating this post as new offers appear throughout the weekend, so keep checking back for the latest deals and discounts.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured deals\nThe best Apple deals\nThe best headphone and earbud deals\nBest speaker deals\nThe best smart home deals\nThe best gaming deals\nGood deals on other gadgets and goods\n\nFeatured deals\nThe best Apple deals\nYou can get a 10th-gen iPad for $279 ($70 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is $30 more than its lowest price to date. Apple’s entry-level tablet uses an A14 Bionic chipset and offers a 10.9-inch display that’s roomy enough for almost any task you can carry out on it. Although you might want a higher-end model for 4K editing and heavier workloads, the entry-level iPad is great for almost any other moderate need, including browsing, streaming, and doodling (it’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the newer USB-C model). It can even handle some light gaming. Read our review.\nYou can grab a four-pack of AirTags for $69.99 ($30 off) at Amazon and Best Buy right now, which matches the bundle’s best price to date. Apple’s ultra wideband trackers are our No. 1 pick for iPhone users, as they allow you to track your keys, bag, and other belongings within inches of their location using Apple’s extensive Find My network. They also feature replaceable batteries, carry an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and offer tracking alerts to help prevent stalking. Hell, you can even now share their location with a handful of airlines, courtesy of a recent iOS 18 update. Read our original review.\nThe 13-inch M2 MacBook Air with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD is down to $749 ($250 off) at Amazon (at checkout) or $799 at Best Buy. The last-gen Air is still a great laptop for most people, especially now that it starts with 16GB of RAM. That gives it enough memory to handle macOS Sequoia’s AI-based Apple Intelligence features, along with enough power for light video, photo, and audio work. It’s also noticeably lighter than the MacBook Pro, yet it still lasts all day thanks to the efficiency of Apple’s M2 chip.\nThe best headphone and earbud deals\nSony’s WH-1000XM4 are available for around $248 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The last-gen pair of headphones remain a solid alternative to the XM5 thanks to their fantastic noise cancellation and overall call quality. They last up to 30 hours per charge, support Google Fast Pair and Find My on Android devices, and feature multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. They also support 360-degree spatial audio and, unlike the latest model, tout a foldable design that’s far more portable. Read our review.\nThe Bose QuietComfort Headphones are down to $249 ($100 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose’s online storefront. The midrange headphones are the spiritual successor to the Bose QuietComfort 45, offering similar audio quality but more granular control over ANC and ambient passthrough levels. They don a similar design and form factor to the QC45, too, which — as its namesake teases — prioritizes comfort.\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are matching their all-time low of $229 ($70 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Bose. They’re a solid pair of wireless earbuds if you want to enjoy music without completely plugging your ear canals. Unlike bone-conduction headphones, which send vibrations through your skull for similar open-ear benefits, the Open Earbuds clip onto your ear lobe. Bose’s so-called OpenAudio technology then directs audio toward your eardrums. They’re an interesting alternative that might be more ideal for workouts than other products, but by nature, they don’t perform as well as traditional earbuds. Read our review.\nNow through February 17th, Anker’s Soundcore Sport X10 are on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) — just $5 shy of their all-time low — when you buy them from Anker’s eBay storefront and use offer code PREZ20 at checkout. Despite being an older model, the Sport X10 remain a great pair of budget-friendly workout earbuds with flexible ear hooks, a robust IPX7 rating for water and sweat resistance, and powerful bass. They’re certainly not on par with something like the Powerbeats Pro 2, but they’re a solid gym pick for the price.\nBest speaker deals\nYou can get the Bose SoundLink Flex (second-gen) for $129 ($20 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and Bose, which is about $12 more than its lowest price to date. The portable Bluetooth speaker is water and dust-resistant, said to be rugged enough to withstand drops, lasts up to 12 hours per charge, and allows you to pair it with another for stereo playback. Its flat profile makes it easy to slip into a bag, but you can also use the integrated strap to attach it using a carabiner or other means.\nYou can buy a standalone Echo Pop for $29.99 ($10 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, or pick it up with a heart-themed faceplate and sleeve for $40.98 ($23 off) at Amazon. That’s nowhere near the lowest price we’ve seen on either configuration — we’ve seen it drop to $18 in the past — but it is the first time Amazon’s entry-level smart speaker has gone on sale since the holidays. It delivers good sound for its size, doubles as an Eero mesh Wi-Fi extender, and offers a lot of Alexa-based smarts, allowing you to control various smart devices with your voice, check sports scores, set alarms, and more. Read our review.\nThe best smart home deals\nYou can grab a Blink Outdoor 4 with a Sync Module 2 for $69.99 ($30 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and The Home Depot. That’s not as good as the bundle’s previous price tag of $40, but it’s still decent for a wireless security camera that can work in the elements. The 1080p camera offers all the essentials needed to monitor areas inside or outside your home, including night vision, two-way video, and motion detection support with person detection (if you pay the $3 monthly fee). It builds on its predecessor with a broader field of view, too, so you can see more of its coverage area.\nAmazon’s latest Echo Show 5 is on sale for $69.99 ($20 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, which is its third-best price to date. The smart display offers better sound and mics than its predecessor while retaining its small, 5.5-inch footprint, which makes it a great bedside alarm clock. As an Alexa-enabled smart display, you can also use it to control other smart home devices with your voice, like your lights.\nThe Mill Food Recycler is on sale for $874 ($125 off) directly from Mill, which is one of its best prices to date. The smart trash can is designed to grind food scraps and convert them into chicken food, which you can then either ship to Washington state or use yourself. The latest model can process 40 pounds of leftovers and is slightly faster than the first-gen iteration we tested, too, allowing you to create a coffee ground-like substance in two and a half hours as opposed to 10. \nThe best gaming deals\nNBA 2K25 is down to $24.99 ($45 off) — an all-time low — at Amazon for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S (you can also get it for $19.99 for the Nintendo Switch). The current promo on the basketball simulator comes just in time for the NBA all-star weekend. It’s updated within days of the league-wide roster changes, with realistic lineups reflected across Play Now and GM modes. You can also build a fantasy squad through MyTeam’s collectible card experience, or create a MyPlayer character to act out your own rags to riches story in the NBA.\nThe 49-inch Odyssey G95SD OLED is available for $1,499.99 ($400 off) from Samsung’s online store. That’s a record-low price on Samsung’s newest G9 monitor, though you can get the similarly impressive G95SC from 2023 for $1,014.02 (about $786 off) at Amazon. The QHD-equivalent, ultra-wide curved OLED monitors sport a 240Hz refresh rate and a .03-millisecond response time. The glare-free panel should make it a blast for playing games in most lighting conditions, while adaptive brightness tech detects static on-screen elements and lowers the local brightness to protect the display from burn-in. Both models also feature an RGB ring on the rear that can change dynamically based on what’s happening in your game.\nYou can get the 55-inch Samsung Odyssey Ark (second-gen) for $1,799.99 ($900 off) at Best Buy, B&H Photo, and direct from Samsung. It’s an absolutely unhinged 4K Mini-LED curved display that supports up to 165Hz refresh rate, and you can flip it vertically into “cockpit” mode for a new perspective while gaming or for whatever hardcore productivity needs you might have. Also aiding your productivity is an improved Multi View feature that lets you view up to four independent HDMI or DisplayPort sources simultaneously. It includes a built-in KVM switch and a dedicated control dial for managing its various settings.\nGood deals on other gadgets and goods\nThe Fitbit Charge 6 is on sale at Amazon in white for $115.95 ($44 off), which is one of the better prices we’ve seen in recent months. (Other colors are also on sale for $129.95 at Amazon, Best Buy, and the Google Store). The Charge 6 is one of our favorite fitness trackers, especially of the many Fitbit options, and offers the unique ability to pair with certain gym equipment via Bluetooth. It also offers turn-by-turn navigation via Google Maps, NFC payments, and a vibrant OLED panel, though be forewarned that the always-on display is a major drain on battery life. Read our review.\nAmazon is currently discounting many of its Fire HD tablets, including the latest Fire HD 8, which is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with ads and 32GB of storage starting at $64.99 ($35 off). It can’t compare to higher-end models from Apple and Google, but the 8-inch tablet is a decent Alexa-enabled device if you just need something basic for playing games, streaming, reading, and consuming other forms of entertainment.\nYou can get LG’s 48-inch B4 for $599.99 ($200 off) at Best Buy, which is an all-time low.
