The company’s lawsuit alleges that a man connected to a broader scam network created fake business profiles on Google Maps and sold them for profit. Google was tipped off by a Texas-based locksmith who said someone was impersonating them on Google Maps, which led to the Wednesday lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated,&#8221; Google’s general counsel Halimah DeLaine Prado said Wednesday on <em>CBS Mornings Plus</em>. “Once we&#8217;re alerted to the actual fraud, we take extreme efforts to identify similar fraudulent listings.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Scammers can use Google Maps to fool people in a number of ways. Victims may stumble upon a fake listing that looks real and call the number. Sometimes, the scammer provides the service when the victim shows up, but will upcharge them. Other times, the victim could be routed to a call center, where scammers can try to convince them to pay for something ahead of time but not actually provide the service.

One is focused on improving the application process for developers who request interoperability with Apple’s ecosystem. The other is more exciting for iPhone and iPad users, as it specifically outlines nine iOS-exclusive connectivity features that Apple needs to make available for other platforms to use — the vast majority of which need to be opened up “by the end of 2025 at the latest,” according to the EU ruling.\nOne of the standouts is opening access to iOS notifications, which will finally allow third-party smartwatches to display and interact with them in a manner currently only available on Apple Watch devices. A feature that allows apps to run in the background without interruption will also enable third-party devices to more reliably collect information like news and weather updates from connected iPhones. \nFeatures like SharePlay and audio-switching capabilities that allow Apple headphones to automatically jump between different devices (switching from playing music on an iPad to receiving an incoming call on iPhones, for example) must be made available on third-party earphones and headsets, sparing iPhone users from needing to buy AirPods. Apple also needs to let devices use the same high-bandwidth iPhone connections currently only available on Apple hardware, which could improve connectivity on third-party VR headsets. \nOther platforms will also be able to send and receive data via AirDrop and AirPlay when connected with an Apple device, and iOS will need to support alternative services to both AirDrop and AirPlay. Additional improvements expected for third-party devices include making them easier for iPhone users to set up without downloading a companion app, automatically connecting to Wi-Fi networks via iPhones, and easily receiving contactless payment credentials via NFC transfer. \nThese requirements are legally binding and must be applied for Apple to meet its DMA obligations. Apple risks facing a non-compliance investigation that could eventually result in hefty fines of up to ten percent of Apple’s annual turnover if the EU finds Apple violating DMA rules by not implementing the guidance by its deadlines.\nApple has the opportunity to fight the decisions, subject to judicial review. Such opposition seems likely, given Apple said in a statement to The Verge that the EU’s requirements are “bad for our products and for our European users.” The EU seems confident that its ruling will force the company to open up its walled iOS garden for other platform developers, however.","summary":"The European Union has outlined exactly how Apple needs to improve the interoperability of iOS, and the guidance reveals which features could be available to other smartwatches, headphones, and speakers.
