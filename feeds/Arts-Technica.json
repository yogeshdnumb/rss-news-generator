His fingernails and the whites of his eyes had become silvery. When doctors took a skin biopsy, they could see tiny, dark granules sitting in the fibers of his skin, in his blood vessels, in the membranes of his sweat glands, and in his hair follicles.\nA blood test made clear what the problem was: the concentration of silver in his serum was 423 nmol/L, over 40 times the reference level for a normal result, which is less than 10 nmol/L. The man was diagnosed with a rare case of generalized argyria, a buildup of silver in the body's tissue that causes a blueish-gray discoloration—which is generally permanent.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Beth Mole\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/man-turns-irreversibly-gray-from-an-unidentified-silver-exposure/#comments","content":"\n            His skin, hands, nails, and eyes had turned silvery gray from the exposure.\n          ","contentSnippet":"His skin, hands, nails, and eyes had turned silvery gray from the exposure.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/01/man-turns-irreversibly-gray-from-an-unidentified-silver-exposure/","categories":["Health","Science","Argyria","NEJM","Silver"],"isoDate":"2025-01-10T18:47:28.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jon Brodkin\n        ","title":"Judge ends man’s 11-year quest to dig up landfill and recover $765M in bitcoin","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/judge-ends-mans-11-year-quest-to-dig-up-landfill-and-recover-765m-in-bitcoin/","pubDate":"Fri, 10 Jan 2025 18:36:16 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>A British judge ruled against a man who wants to excavate a landfill where he says a hard drive with access to thousands of bitcoins was mistakenly dumped over 11 years ago.</p>\n<p>Since 2013, James Howells has been hoping to recover a laptop hard drive that he says contains the private key for cryptocurrency which he says he mined in 2009.
