As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24th <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems\">was an absolute mess</a> — and GameStop <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/655626/nintendo-switch-2-gamestop-preorder\">didn’t fare much better</a> later in the week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is still <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/\">accepting sign-ups</a> for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements\">there are strict requirements</a>. Nintendo also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites\">can’t guarantee an invite</a> ahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, at least at traditional US retailers. Additional preorder inventory has popped up intermittently at Walmart and GameStop in recent days; however, so far, none of the major retailers have announced when they will resume accepting preorders, if at all. That being said, if you’re trying to secure a Switch 2, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you’re set up for success if they re-open.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#retailer-landing-pages\">Retailer landing pages</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-switch-2-configurations-are-available\">What Switch 2 configurations are available?</a></li><li><a href=\"#a-few-essentials-tips-to-keep-in-mind\">A few essentials tips to keep in mind</a><ol><li><a href=\"#create-accounts-for-every-retailer\">Create accounts for every retailer</a></li><li><a href=\"#download-the-mobile-apps\">Download the mobile apps</a></li><li><a href=\"#sign-up-for-retailer-notifications\">Sign up for retailer notifications</a></li><li><a href=\"#skip-the-accessories\">Skip the accessories</a></li><li><a href=\"#try-your-local-brick-and-mortar-store\">Try your local brick-and-mortar store</a></li><li><a href=\"#follow-us-and-others\">Follow us (and others)</a></li></ol></li><li><a href=\"#where-can-i-preorder-the-switch-2\">Where can I preorder the Switch 2?</a><ol><li><a href=\"#my-nintendo-store\">My Nintendo Store</a></li><li><a href=\"#walmart\">Walmart</a></li><li><a href=\"#gamestop\">GameStop</a></li><li><a href=\"#best-buy\">Best Buy</a></li><li><a href=\"#target\">Target</a></li><li><a href=\"#newegg-and-sam-s-club\">Newegg and Sam’s Club</a></li></ol></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"retailer-landing-pages\">Retailer landing pages</h2>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-switch-2-configurations-are-available\">What Switch 2 configurations are available?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latest <em>Mario Kart</em> title, <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2\">Mario Kart World</a></em>. Nintendo is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641933/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-limited-time-production\">on record saying</a> the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you’ll have to pick up <em>Mario Kart World</em> separately <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Mario-Kart-World-U-S-Version/15940407280\">for a whopping $79</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date\">recently raised the price</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button\">Switch 2 Joy-Cons</a> and the  <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details\">Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> in response to tariffs, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"a-few-essentials-tips-to-keep-in-mind\">A few essentials tips to keep in mind</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in console preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/645534/nintendo-switch-2-supply-demand-inventory-us-tariffs-doug-bowser\">build up an inventory</a> of the next-gen system “on a global basis.” That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success&nbsp;<em>ahead</em>&nbsp;of when preorders drop next.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but in the meantime, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"create-accounts-for-every-retailer\">Create accounts for every retailer</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven’t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That’s why it’s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8230; most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"download-the-mobile-apps\">Download the mobile apps</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sign-up-for-retailer-notifications\">Sign up for retailer notifications</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A couple of retailers, specifically&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best Buy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-2/424543.html\">GameStop</a>,&nbsp;allow you to sign up for preorder updates regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they do serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Nintendo-Switch-2-Lifestyle-Image-5.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=6.6,21.305020390944,76.8,60.315078548757\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"skip-the-accessories\">Skip the accessories</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a Switch 2 Pro Controller, carrying cases, and even a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch\">camera accessory for video chats</a>. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"try-your-local-brick-and-mortar-store\">Try your local brick-and-mortar store</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This might come as a surprise in 2025, but preorders aren’t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 shortly following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units — the <a href=\"http://had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles\">GameStop location our own Ash Parrish visited</a>&nbsp;had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles — so it can’t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they’re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"follow-us-and-others\">Follow us (and others)</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As you might expect, we’ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory over the next month or so — or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th.

We’ll be sending special alerts as preorders become available; it’s also a great way to stay in the know regarding the latest deals and discounts, all of which come from a <em>Verge </em>staffer.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A number of other social media accounts — including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://x.com/Wario64\">Wario64</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/IGNDeals/\"><em>IGN</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250423214048/https://x.com/mattswider\">Matt Swider of&nbsp;<em>The Shortcut</em></a>&nbsp;— are likely going to be tracking preorder inventory for the foreseeable future as well, if you’re looking for additional publications / users to follow in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch.</p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/Nintendo-Switch-2-Lifestyle-Tabletop-Image.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.789000007469,100,78.421999985062\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"where-can-i-preorder-the-switch-2\">Where can I preorder the Switch 2?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, and Sam’s Club. We anticipate Amazon opening preorders at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon and other retailers begin offering preorders.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"my-nintendo-store\">My Nintendo Store</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250415162056/https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F\">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to&nbsp;<em>share</em>&nbsp;gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250415162056/https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy\">in the privacy section</a>&nbsp;when logged into your account).</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account …</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which will begin with the first batch of invitations on May 8th.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, in <a href=\"http://Nintendo says that due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”\">a recent update to its site</a>, Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"walmart\">Walmart</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walmart is no longer accepting preorders for the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-System/15949610846/\">standalone Switch 2</a> ($449) or the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-Mario-Kart-World-Bundle/15928868255/\"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a> ($499), though you can still preorder games like <em><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-U-S-Version/15949810208/\">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> ($69) and accessories like the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nintendo-Switch-2-Carrying-Case-Screen-Protector/15955005002?classType=REGULAR\">Switch 2 Carrying Case &amp; Screen Protector</a> ($39.88). That being said, Walmart’s website&nbsp;still indicates that, if you manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"gamestop\">GameStop</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">GameStop currently isn’t accepting preorders for the <a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-2/424543.html\">standalone console</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/nintendo-switch-2/products/nintendo-switch-2-console-and-mario-kart-world-bundle/424542.html\"><em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>. If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/switch-2-buyers-hold-on-to-your-original-switch-the-resale-is-not-worth-it-2000592660\">confirmed to <em>Gizmodo</em></a> that the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-buy\">Best Buy</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Best Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-system-multi/6614313.p\">standalone console</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-multi/6614325.p\"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a> right now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear (<a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/clp-video-games/nintendo-member-offer/pcmcat1742915358934.c?id=pcmcat1742915358934\">excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware</a>). That privilege will <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/best-buy-membership/pcmcat1679668833285.c\">run you at least $49.99 a year</a>, though both membership tiers also grant you access to a number of exclusive perks, including limited-time discounts and free two-day shipping.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"target\">Target</h3>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Target has sold out of its initial preorder stock for both the <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-console/-/A-94693225#lnk=sametab\">standalone Switch 2</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-console-mario-kart-world-bundle/-/A-94693226#lnk=sametab\"><em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a>, along with many accessories.

Nintendo is still accepting sign-ups for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that there are strict requirements. Nintendo also can’t guarantee an invite ahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know.\nWe don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, at least at traditional US retailers. Additional preorder inventory has popped up intermittently at Walmart and GameStop in recent days; however, so far, none of the major retailers have announced when they will resume accepting preorders, if at all. That being said, if you’re trying to secure a Switch 2, we suggest keeping an eye on the retailers below and taking a few steps to ensure you’re set up for success if they re-open.\n\n\n\n\n\nRetailer landing pages\nWhat Switch 2 configurations are available?\nA few essentials tips to keep in mind\nCreate accounts for every retailer\nDownload the mobile apps\nSign up for retailer notifications\nSkip the accessories\nTry your local brick-and-mortar store\nFollow us (and others)\n\nWhere can I preorder the Switch 2?\nMy Nintendo Store\nWalmart\nGameStop\nBest Buy\nTarget\nNewegg and Sam’s Club\n\n\nRetailer landing pages\nWhat Switch 2 configurations are available?\nAt launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latest Mario Kart title, Mario Kart World. Nintendo is on record saying the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is easily the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you’ll have to pick up Mario Kart World separately for a whopping $79.\nIt’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo recently raised the price of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons and the  Switch 2 Pro Controller in response to tariffs, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch.\nA few essentials tips to keep in mind\nIf the initial preorder launch of the Switch 2 is any indication, retailers are woefully under-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest in console preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 seems to be limited despite the fact Nintendo supposedly had time to build up an inventory of the next-gen system “on a global basis.” That being the case, we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success ahead of when preorders drop next.\nWe’ll continue to do our best to let you know which retailers have inventory as we approach June 5th, but in the meantime, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your chances.\nCreate accounts for every retailer\nFirst things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and other retailers if you haven’t done so already. Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5. That’s why it’s in your best interest to ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account prior to making your purchase.\n\n… most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line\n\n\nSetting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line.\nDownload the mobile apps\nIf you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch.\nSign up for retailer notifications\nA couple of retailers, specifically Best Buy and GameStop, allow you to sign up for preorder updates regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they do serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward.\nSkip the accessories\nNintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a Switch 2 Pro Controller, carrying cases, and even a camera accessory for video chats. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2.\nTry your local brick-and-mortar store\nThis might come as a surprise in 2025, but preorders aren’t only available online. A handful of retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop, opened in-store preorders for the Switch 2 shortly following their online release. Each store has only been allocated a handful of launch units — the GameStop location our own Ash Parrish visited had been allotted 44 bundles and 19 regular Switch 2 consoles — so it can’t hurt to ask the folks at the store nearest you if they’re still accepting preorders. The chances are slim, sure, but who knows? You might get lucky.\nFollow us (and others)\nAs you might expect, we’ll be closely monitoring Switch 2 inventory over the next month or so — or longer if it remains unavailable following its release on June 5th. Bookmark our main deals hub, and if you haven’t already, subscribe to our Verge Deals newsletter! We’ll be sending special alerts as preorders become available; it’s also a great way to stay in the know regarding the latest deals and discounts, all of which come from a Verge staffer.\nA number of other social media accounts — including Wario64, IGN, and Matt Swider of The Shortcut — are likely going to be tracking preorder inventory for the foreseeable future as well, if you’re looking for additional publications / users to follow in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch.\nWhere can I preorder the Switch 2?\nRight now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, Target, Newegg, and Sam’s Club. We anticipate Amazon opening preorders at some point, but based on previous console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon and other retailers begin offering preorders.\nMy Nintendo Store\nUnsurprisingly, one of the few confirmed retailers is the My Nintendo Store, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and select the console configuration you prefer, along with any desired accessories. Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.\nCurrently, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years of age. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to share gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so in the privacy section when logged into your account).\n\nConsole and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account …\n\n\nOnce invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which will begin with the first batch of invitations on May 8th.\nAdditional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, in a recent update to its site, Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”\nWalmart\nWalmart is no longer accepting preorders for the standalone Switch 2 ($449) or the Mario Kart World bundle ($499), though you can still preorder games like Donkey Kong Bananza ($69) and accessories like the Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector ($39.88). That being said, Walmart’s website still indicates that, if you manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th.\nGameStop\nGameStop currently isn’t accepting preorders for the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle. If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also confirmed to Gizmodo that the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift.\nBest Buy\nBest Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle right now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup.\nAdditionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear (excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware). That privilege will run you at least $49.99 a year, though both membership tiers also grant you access to a number of exclusive perks, including limited-time discounts and free two-day shipping.\nTarget\nTarget has sold out of its initial preorder stock for both the standalone Switch 2 and the Mario Kart World bundle, along with many accessories. Some games, including the Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ($69.99), are still available.\nNewegg and Sam’s Club\nAs far as we know, neither Newegg nor Sam’s Club opened preorders on April 24th. However, Newegg has published a landing page for both the standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle, indicating it will have Switch 2 stock at some point. The same applies to Sam’s Club, which currently has a retail listing for the bundle. You’ll need a Club membership ($50 a year) to take advantage of the latter; however, given Sam’s Club requires you to sign up for a premium subscription to shop, you might have better luck when preorders do open.\nUpdate, April 26th: Updated to include the latest information on Switch 2 preorders, along with several additional tips for securing Nintendo’s newest console at launch.","summary":"Following a brief delay stemming from the Trump administration’s on-again, off-again tariff policy, Nintendo officially opened up preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2.

Talks to develop rules for deep-sea mining are still ongoing through the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a process that missed an initial <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23778923/key-deadline-deep-sea-mining-regulation-battery-minerals\">2023 deadline</a> and has continued to stymie efforts to start commercially mining the deep sea.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“A dangerous precedent”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Fast-tracking deep-sea mining by bypassing the ISA’s global regulatory processes would set a dangerous precedent and would be a violation of customary international law,” Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition that has advocated for a moratorium on deep sea mining, said in a press statement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ISA was established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. More than 160 nations have ratified the convention, but the United States has not. Ignoring the convention, the executive order Trump signed directs federal agencies to expedite the process for issuing licenses to companies seeking to recover minerals “in areas beyond national jurisdiction” in accordance with the <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF12608\">1980 US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act</a>.

Talks to develop rules for deep-sea mining are still ongoing through the International Seabed Authority (ISA), a process that missed an initial 2023 deadline and has continued to stymie efforts to start commercially mining the deep sea.\n\n“A dangerous precedent”\n\n\n“Fast-tracking deep-sea mining by bypassing the ISA’s global regulatory processes would set a dangerous precedent and would be a violation of customary international law,” Duncan Currie, legal adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition that has advocated for a moratorium on deep sea mining, said in a press statement.\nThe ISA was established by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. More than 160 nations have ratified the convention, but the United States has not. Ignoring the convention, the executive order Trump signed directs federal agencies to expedite the process for issuing licenses to companies seeking to recover minerals “in areas beyond national jurisdiction” in accordance with the 1980 US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act. A country’s territorial jurisdiction only extends roughly 200 nautical miles from shore.\nThe Trump administration wants to work with industry “to counter China’s growing influence over seabed mineral resources,” the executive order says. However, no country has yet to commercially mine the deep ocean where depths reach about 656 feet (200 meters) in international waters.
