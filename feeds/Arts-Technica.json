An Internet connection is required for the initial loading and unloading process, but after that, the system with the Virtual Game Card can play the downloaded game completely offline.\nFor those who don't want to constantly load and unload their virtual games between systems, Nintendo also offers an \"Online License\" feature deep in the Switch's system menu. When this feature is turned on, if you load a digital game without a Virtual Game Card present, the Switch will perform an online check to confirm that your Nintendo Account actually has access to that game. Nintendo recommends this feature for players who want to share games across three or more Switch units.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kyle Orland\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-imposes-new-limits-on-sharing-for-digital-switch-games/#comments","content":"\n            New \"Virtual Game Card\" system prevents simultaneous online play from a single purchase.\n          ","contentSnippet":"New \"Virtual Game Card\" system prevents simultaneous online play from a single purchase.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-imposes-new-limits-on-sharing-for-digital-switch-games/","categories":["Gaming","nintendo switch 2"],"isoDate":"2025-04-30T16:44:18.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Eric Berger\n        ","title":"After convincing senators he supports Artemis, Isaacman nomination advances","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/after-his-support-for-artemis-senate-committee-advances-isaacman-nomination/","pubDate":"Wed, 30 Apr 2025 16:32:40 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>The US Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday advanced the nomination of private astronaut and businessman Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA to the Senate floor, setting up the final step before he is confirmed.</p>\n<p>The vote was not unanimous, at 19–9, with all of the nay votes coming from senators on the Democratic side of the aisle.</p>\n<p>However, some key Democrats voted in favor of Isaacman, including the ranking member of the committee, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.

Intel says that version 32.0.101.6734 of its graphics driver can speed up average frame rates in some games by around 10 percent and can speed up \"1 percent low FPS\" (that is, for any given frames-per-second measurement, whatever your frame rate is the slowest 1 percent of the time) by as much as 25 percent. This should, in theory, make games run better in general and ease some of the stuttering you notice when your game's performance dips down to that 1 percent level.\nIntel's performance comparisons were made using an MSI Claw 7 AI+ using an Arc 140V GPU, and they compare the performance of driver version 32.0.101.6732 (released April 2) to version 32.0.101.6734 (released April 8). The two additional driver packages Intel has released since then will contain the improvements, too.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Andrew Cunningham\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance/#comments","content":"\n            Laptops with Core Ultra 200V CPUs, Arc 130V or 140V GPUs should benefit.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Laptops with Core Ultra 200V CPUs, Arc 130V or 140V GPUs should benefit.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/intel-says-its-rolling-out-laptop-gpu-drivers-with-10-to-25-better-performance/","categories":["Tech","Intel"],"isoDate":"2025-04-29T22:13:02.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ryan Whitwam\n        ","title":"OpenAI rolls back update that made ChatGPT a sycophantic mess","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/openai-rolls-back-update-that-made-chatgpt-a-sycophantic-mess/","pubDate":"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 21:15:37 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>ChatGPT users have become frustrated with the AI model's tone, and OpenAI is taking action.
