A few years later, the picture is getting clear. According to new Stanford University-led research examining over 300 million text samples across multiple sectors, AI language models now assist in writing up to a quarter of professional communications. It's having a large impact, especially in less-educated parts of the United States.\n\"Our study shows the emergence of a new reality in which firms, consumers and even international organizations substantially rely on generative AI for communications,\" wrote the researchers.\nThe researchers tracked large language model (LLM) adoption across industries from January 2022 to September 2024 using a dataset that included 687,241 consumer complaints submitted to the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), 537,413 corporate press releases, 304.3 million job postings, and 15,919 United Nations press releases.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Benj Edwards\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-surprised-to-find-less-educated-areas-adopting-ai-writing-tools-faster/#comments","content":"\n            Stanford researchers analyzed 305 million texts, revealing AI-writing trends.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Stanford researchers analyzed 305 million texts, revealing AI-writing trends.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-surprised-to-find-less-educated-areas-adopting-ai-writing-tools-faster/","categories":["AI","Biz & IT","Tech","AI research","AI writing","AI writing detectors","ChatGPT","chatgtp","large language models","machine learning","Stanford"],"isoDate":"2025-03-03T22:32:59.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","title":"TSMC to invest $100B as Trump demands more US-made chips, report says","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/tsmc-will-reportedly-invest-100b-to-expand-us-chip-fab-buildouts/","pubDate":"Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:49:57 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Striking a four-year deal with President Donald Trump, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
