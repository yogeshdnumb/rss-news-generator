Google, saying, “…the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.”\nThat ended the biggest tech antitrust trial since the US took on Microsoft in the 1990s — possibly aside from the government’s antitrust case targeting Google’s ad business — but it’s also just the start of the process. Now, lawyers for Google and the Department of Justice are arguing over the ruling, as well as what to do about the company and its products.\nThe DOJ argued that Google struck anticompetitive deals with Apple and other companies for prime placement of its search engine. Google maintains that its dominant market share is the result of a superior product. The DOJ says options to resolve the situation include breaking up Google to separate products like Chrome, Search, and Android, but it may be a while until we hear about their full plan.\nRead on below for all of the updates and notes from the case.\nDOJ says it will let Google pay Apple for services unrelated to search.\n\t\t\t\nApple’s attempt to intervene in the Google Search antitrust trial is denied\n\t\t\t\nApple asks court to halt Google search monopoly case\n\t\t\t\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai tells employees to expect a hard 2025.\n\t\t\t\nEddy Cue explains why Apple won’t make a search engine\n\t\t\t\nApple would like to step in to defend its Google search deal.\n\t\t\t\nGoogle to court: we’ll change our Apple deal, but please let us keep Chrome\n\t\t\t\nGoogle’s counteroffer to the government trying to break it up is unbundling Android apps\n\t\t\t\nGoogle responds to DOJ’s ‘extreme proposal.’\n\t\t\t\nDOJ says Google must sell Chrome to crack open its search monopoly\n\t\t\t\nGoogle workers to DOJ: we need protections to make your breakup effective\n\t\t\t\nCould Chrome be ready to Rumble?\n\t\t\t\nUS lawyers will reportedly try to force Google to sell Chrome and unbundle Android\n\t\t\t\nGoogle is replacing the exec in charge of Search and ads\n\t\t\t\nHow the DOJ wants to break up Google’s search monopoly\n\t\t\t\nA Google breakup is on the table, say DOJ lawyers\n\t\t\t\nThe DOJ will have its proposed plan to deal with Google’s monopoly soon.\n\t\t\t\nThe DOJ wants info on Google’s AI strategy to bust up its search monopoly\n\t\t\t\nYelp sues Google for antitrust violations\n\t\t\t\nWhat Google rivals want after the DOJ’s antitrust trial win\n\t\t\t\nGoogle lost its first antitrust case, so what happens next?\n\t\t\t\n‘There’s no price’ Microsoft could pay Apple to use Bing: all the spiciest parts of the Google antitrust ruling\n\t\t\t\nNow that Google is a monopolist, what’s next?\n\t\t\t\nJudge rules that Google ‘is a monopolist’ in US antitrust case\n\t\t\t\nWell, that’s an interesting name for it.\n\t\t\t\nAs Google’s antitrust trial wraps, DOJ seeks sanctions over missing messages\n\t\t\t\nMultibillion-dollar Apple deal looms large in Google antitrust trial\n\t\t\t\nGoogle paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 to be Safari’s default search engine.\n\t\t\t\nA Google witness let slip just how much it pays Apple for Safari search\n\t\t\t\n‘Android is a massive tracking device.’\n\t\t\t\nHere’s a rare look at Google’s most lucrative search queries\n\t\t\t\nSundar Pichai argues in court that Google isn’t evil, it’s just a business\n\t\t\t\nGoogle agreed to not promote Chrome to Safari users.\n\t\t\t\nGoogle once asked Apple to preload its search app on iOS\n\t\t\t\nIt’s Internet Explorer day in US v.

Bluesky, which relies on its own decentralized <a href=\"https://atproto.com/\">AT Protocol</a> for social networking, continues to grow and saw a surge of users after the 2024 election, though with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293920/bluesky-700000-new-users-week-x-threads\">somewhere north of 14.5 million use</a><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3l7bicu2v252r\">rs</a>, it&rsquo;s still well behind Threads.

— and while a lot of platforms rushed in to try and be the next big microblogging service, many haven’t survived. Threads, Mastodon, and Bluesky have all proven to be viable alternatives, but places like Pebble (formerly T2) and Post News didn’t make it.\nThreads is perhaps the likely successor, having reached 275 million monthly users as of October 2024, and it seems committed to fediverse integration by building features around the ActivityPub protocol. Bluesky, which relies on its own decentralized AT Protocol for social networking, continues to grow and saw a surge of users after the 2024 election, though with somewhere north of 14.5 million users, it’s still well behind Threads. Mastodon, which also uses the ActivityPub protocol, was already well-established by the time Musk bought Twitter but has struggled to grow its active user base.\nThere still isn’t a clear successor to Twitter. X hasn’t become the massive “everything app” that Musk says he wants it to be. But despite the success of Threads, continued existence of Mastodon, and the growth of Bluesky, X is still the place where many people and companies post things before they go anywhere else — at

We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re almost all the same and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (<a href=\"https://www.powera.com/c/nintendo/nintendo-switch/controllers/\">PowerA</a> and <a href=\"https://pdp.com/collections/nintendo-switch-controllers\">PDP</a> make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), there are certain things that it likely won’t be able to do unless otherwise noted:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It won’t have HD rumble. This is what Nintendo calls its advanced haptic feedback, which is more precise than that of many third-party controllers and more akin to Sony’s haptics engine in its subtlety. That said, some more limited rumble may be present.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Many third-party Switch controllers don’t have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, though more options are starting to implement the latter feature with varying degrees of quality.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most non-Nintendo options lack an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines, which unlock special features in some games.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most third-party options won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.)&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22690100/how-to-pair-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-nintendo-switch\">pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch</a> is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official <a href=\"https://howl.link/lij43lpwkhtzg\">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>.

We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch and other compatible platforms, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, racers like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and shooters like <em>Overwatch 2</em>. We pay attention to how buttons, triggers, analog sticks, and the D-pad feel, noting whether any of them feel mushy or stiff. For controllers that support sensitivity customization, we note how easy it is to make these adjustments and how they feel compared to their default settings.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Connectivity</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Does it support Bluetooth?

It launched alongside the console in 2017 as a more traditional alternative to Nintendo’s quirky Joy-Cons, and in many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also the only controller we’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.</p>\n\n<p>Given the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973\">if you have no more than two controllers</a> connected to your Switch at once.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xKHdxh\">The best Switch controller for handheld mode</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Joy-Con slots / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> No / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> via Joy-Con slots / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p>I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. That’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.</p>\n\n<p>The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One-half slides into each side of the Switch&nbsp;console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23334097/cfaulkner_141231_5091_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Split Pad Pro fits in your Switch’s Joy-Con slots and doubles as a standalone controller with the optional attachment set.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — not to mention support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC&nbsp;— so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23007610/hori-split-pad-pro-attachment-nintendo-switch-price-features-review\">Split Pad Pro Attachment</a> that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t try to add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).</p>\n\n<p>The company also sells the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348870/hori-split-pad-compact-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-features\">Split Pad Compact</a>, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Compact-Light-Yellow/dp/B0BDSNHLDY\"><strong>costs $50</strong></a> (you can also get it <a href=\"https://howl.link/4thbwb6qz0qd2\">with an Attachment Set for $79.99</a>). It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"read-our-hori-split-pad-pro-review\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871866/hori-split-pad-pro-controller-nintendo-switch-daemon-x-machina-review\">Read our Hori Split Pad Pro review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ZdMFHG\">The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></em></p>\n\n<p>On the surface, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0D41BBD7P\">GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0CFX7PKFV\">KingKong 3 Max</a> are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.</p>\n\n<p>But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JluAuIJ-tSY\">iFixit explains here</a>. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, both controllers now feature detachable rear-facing buttons. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they also won’t easily dislodge.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/gulikit-kk3-pro.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723395278369,100,78.553209443262\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;GuliKit’s newest Switch controllers offer ample customization.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter protruding variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer <em>a lot</em>. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of it more easily.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nwIiGD\">A Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL\">8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. </p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<p>It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the 22-hour battery, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.</p>\n\n<p>The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options because it includes 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24827602/61ZrQruCQWL._SL1500_.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.772212081113,100,78.455575837775\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 8BitDo Ultimate is a terrific alternative to Nintendo’s official pro controller.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"DQLgpj\">A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power: </strong>Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSPH1JYV/ref=twister_B0D1HQLSJ1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1\">8BitDo Pro 2</a> is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller.

Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09M8CVMYF\">$19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2</a> lets you turn a Bluetooth&nbsp;controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)</p>\n\n<p>To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8bitdo-wireless-usb-adapter-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.337092227145,100,77.325815545711\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;8BitDo’s dongle supports most Bluetooth controllers, including official Xbox and PlayStation gamepads.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 8BitDo\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: 8BitDo\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://support.8bitdo.com/Manual/USB-Adapter-2/xbox-switch.html\">8BitDo has an extensive support page</a> that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKG18DR\">and a USB hub</a>), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ayIYQW\">Other Switch controllers we tested</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pJBZ31\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-Professional-Handheld-Nintendo/dp/B0CFLVJBBD/\">Nitro Deck</a> / <a href=\"https://amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8YGPT3G/\">Nitro Deck Plus</a></h3>\n\n<p>We like CRKD’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review\"><strong>Nitro Deck</strong></a> around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though, not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up <a href=\"https://crkd.gg/collections/allndp\"><strong>Nitro Deck Plus</strong></a> adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lK3UFj\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Wireless-Controller-Switch-Drifting-Nintendo/dp/B0CDX449NJ\">GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</a></h3>\n\n<p>We recently tested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Wireless-Controller-Switch-Drifting-Nintendo/dp/B0CDX449NJ\"><strong>GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</strong></a> ($45.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0D41BBD7P\">GuliKit KingKong 3 </a>— including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit can’t claim. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lru39S\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\">PowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller</a></h3>\n\n<p>We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\"><strong>GameCube Style Wireless Controller</strong></a> ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Black/dp/B098TX8QB6\"><strong>PowerA Enhanced Wireless</strong></a><strong> </strong>($59.99).

While the removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient given they can be detached for wireless use, their tiny contourless design isn’t that comfortable for long gaming sessions or large hands. And while Nintendo has taken steps to address the dreaded Joy-Con drift and earlier quality control problems, some issues persist.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nA Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nIn this buying guide, we focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed to match your play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re almost all the same and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (PowerA and PDP make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)\nAlso, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), there are certain things that it likely won’t be able to do unless otherwise noted:\nIt won’t have HD rumble. This is what Nintendo calls its advanced haptic feedback, which is more precise than that of many third-party controllers and more akin to Sony’s haptics engine in its subtlety. That said, some more limited rumble may be present. \nMany third-party Switch controllers don’t have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, though more options are starting to implement the latter feature with varying degrees of quality.\nMost non-Nintendo options lack an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines, which unlock special features in some games. \nMost third-party options won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.) \nWhile some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.\nIf you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. It’s the only traditional gamepad that checks all the boxes above — minus the 3.5mm audio jack — and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and Max, meanwhile, make for great Xbox-style controllers with exhaustive customization, while the Hori Split Pad Pro is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s 8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller and DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller, both of which are worth checking out.\n\n\nHow we test Nintendo Switch controllers\nWe test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch and other compatible platforms, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters like Overwatch 2. We pay attention to how buttons, triggers, analog sticks, and the D-pad feel, noting whether any of them feel mushy or stiff. For controllers that support sensitivity customization, we note how easy it is to make these adjustments and how they feel compared to their default settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nConnectivity\nDoes it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality\nDo the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra features\nAre there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macros? Can you use it on multiple platforms?\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomization\nCan you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nIs it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?\n\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nNearly eight years down the road, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller is still the best gamepad for the Switch. It launched alongside the console in 2017 as a more traditional alternative to Nintendo’s quirky Joy-Cons, and in many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality.\nAside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also the only controller we’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.\nThe buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.\nGiven the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only if you have no more than two controllers connected to your Switch at once.)\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nSupported Platforms: Switch / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No\nI’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. That’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.\nThe Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One-half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.\n\n\nThe Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — not to mention support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Pro Attachment that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t try to add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).\nThe company also sells the Split Pad Compact, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that costs $50 (you can also get it with an Attachment Set for $79.99). It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.\nRead our Hori Split Pad Pro review.\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nOn the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.\nBut there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).\nAdditionally, both controllers now feature detachable rear-facing buttons. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they also won’t easily dislodge. \nThe longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter protruding variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.\nIn summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of it more easily.\nA Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\n8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. \n\n\nIt also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the 22-hour battery, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.\nThe Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options because it includes 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.\nAs for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\nThe 8BitDo Pro 2 is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. \nIt has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.\nWith 8BitDo’s Ultimate software on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. \nOn its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for $50 (or $54.99 if you want one of the incredibly cool translucent blue, purple, or green editions).\nRead our 8BitDo Pro 2 review.\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nThere are many other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)\nTo our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app. \n\n\n8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.\nIf you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nNitro Deck / Nitro Deck Plus\nWe like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though, not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).\nGameSir T4 Cyclone Pro\nWe recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($45.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit can’t claim. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.\nPowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller\nWe also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($59.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.\nWhat’s coming next?\nThe Switch 2 is what’s coming next. Nintendo plans to announce more details regarding its second-gen hybrid console on April 2nd; however, based on what we’ve seen thus far, it looks like it will sport a redesigned set of Joy-Con controllers and changes to the attachments slots. The new Joy-Cons are rumored to feature an optical sensor that allows them to function as mice when held horizontally, so even if current-gen controllers are compatible, it’s possible that some newer games might not fully support existing models.\nThat brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Although Nintendo has confirmed some level of continuity going into the next generation — the biggest being backward compatibility with original Switch cartridges — most hardware specifics remain a mystery, though do we anticipate some support for current-gen hardware.\nAs for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re seemingly in a holding pattern. 8BitDo has announced an Ultimate 2 controller with TRM analog sticks, and presumably, there will be a version compatible with Switch, even if one hasn’t been announced yet. There’s nothing else notable on the immediate horizon, however, and that probably won’t change until the Switch 2 arrives later this year.\nUpdate, March 7th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability.","summary":"The best Nintendo Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with it.

Today, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/03/07/apple-alivecor-itc-case-patents/\">upheld a decision</a> that the medical device maker’s EKG patents are not actually patentable. As a result, the Apple Watch won’t face a second import ban from the International Trade Commission (ITC).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This back and forth between AliveCor and Apple began in 2021. AliveCor went to the ITC claiming Apple had infringed on its EKG patents. The ITC ruled in AliveCor’s favor, recommending an import ban that would’ve prevented the sale of Apple Watches with the EKG feature in the US. However, it didn’t immediately go into effect because the Patent Trial and Appeal Board also ruled that the three patents in question weren’t valid. For the import ban to go forward, AliveCor would’ve had to win its <a href=\"https://www.kardia.com/assets/images/Combined-PTAB-Notice-of-Appeal.pdf\">appeal</a> of the PTAB decision — which it didn’t.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We are deeply disappointed by the Court’s decisions this morning and that the Court did not review the available secondary considerations, which the ITC found to be persuasive in their&nbsp;finding of validity,” says Sanjay Voleti, AliveCor’s chief business officer. “We will continue to explore all available legal options, including potential appeals, to defend our position that our patents are valid and that Apple infringed our intellectual property&nbsp;rights.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We thank the Federal Circuit for its careful consideration in this case.

Today, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has upheld a decision that the medical device maker’s EKG patents are not actually patentable. As a result, the Apple Watch won’t face a second import ban from the International Trade Commission (ITC).\nThis back and forth between AliveCor and Apple began in 2021. AliveCor went to the ITC claiming Apple had infringed on its EKG patents. The ITC ruled in AliveCor’s favor, recommending an import ban that would’ve prevented the sale of Apple Watches with the EKG feature in the US. However, it didn’t immediately go into effect because the Patent Trial and Appeal Board also ruled that the three patents in question weren’t valid. For the import ban to go forward, AliveCor would’ve had to win its appeal of the PTAB decision — which it didn’t.\n“We are deeply disappointed by the Court’s decisions this morning and that the Court did not review the available secondary considerations, which the ITC found to be persuasive in their finding of validity,” says Sanjay Voleti, AliveCor’s chief business officer. “We will continue to explore all available legal options, including potential appeals, to defend our position that our patents are valid and that Apple infringed our intellectual property rights.”\n“We thank the Federal Circuit for its careful consideration in this case. Apple’s teams have worked tirelessly over many years to develop industry-leading health, wellness and safety features that meaningfully impact users’ lives, and we intend to stay on this path,” Apple spokesperson Fred Sainz tells The Verge.\nAliveCor used the same legal strategy as Masimo, another medical device maker.
