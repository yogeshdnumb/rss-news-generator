Over the years, RoboBee has learned to fly, dive, and hover. The latest improvement: RoboBee has learned how to stick the landing, thanks to biomechanical improvements to its landing gear modeled on the crane fly, which has a similar wingspan and body size to the RoboBee platform. The details of this achievement appear in a <a href=\"http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adq3059\">new paper</a> published in the journal Science Robotics.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/geometry-could-hold-the-secret-to-rapid-acceleration-of-a-mantis-shrimp-strike/\">previously reported</a>, the ultimate goal of the RoboBee initiative is to build a swarm of tiny interconnected robots capable of sustained, untethered flight—a significant technological challenge, given the insect-sized scale, which changes the various forces at play. In 2019, Wood's group <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1322-0\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-ml-dynamic=\"true\" data-ml-dynamic-type=\"sl\" data-orig-url=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1322-0\" data-ml-id=\"1\" data-ml=\"true\" data-xid=\"fr1744806802138ffi\" data-skimlinks-tracking=\"xid:fr1744806802138ffi\">announced its achievement</a> of the lightest insect-scale robot so far to have achieved sustained, untethered flight—an improved version called the RoboBee X-Wing.

Credit: Harvard Microrobotics Laboratory\n  \n\n    \n\n    \nSeveral years ago, Harvard University roboticist Robert Wood made headlines when his lab constructed RoboBee, a tiny robot capable of partially untethered flight. Over the years, RoboBee has learned to fly, dive, and hover. The latest improvement: RoboBee has learned how to stick the landing, thanks to biomechanical improvements to its landing gear modeled on the crane fly, which has a similar wingspan and body size to the RoboBee platform. The details of this achievement appear in a new paper published in the journal Science Robotics.\nAs previously reported, the ultimate goal of the RoboBee initiative is to build a swarm of tiny interconnected robots capable of sustained, untethered flight—a significant technological challenge, given the insect-sized scale, which changes the various forces at play.
