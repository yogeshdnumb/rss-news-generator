It’s likely one of the bigger tech purchases you’ll make, and there are a ludicrous number of models, sizes, form factors, and configurations to pick from. We <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review\">review and test a wide swath</a> of them here at <em>The Verge</em>, and we’re constantly considering what’s the best and who it’s best for.</p>\n\n<p>Our overall pick for most people has been, and continues to be, the MacBook Air — particularly, as of March 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review\">M4 model</a>. Unless you’re forced to use Windows for specific software needs or you fancy yourself a hardcore gamer, it remains the best option for the average user who wants something portable with excellent battery life and great performance for productivity tasks.</p>\n\n<p>Though the MacBook Air is the easy recommendation for most people, that doesn’t make it the answer for everyone. What if you need more power for video or photo editing, or crunching large datasets? What if you need to run Windows? What if you play lots of games and want to take them with you? Or what if you just want something unique — or even, gasp, repairable? We’ve got some recommendations, including a Chromebook or two, a laptop with two screens, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24319419/apple-macbook-pro-m4-max-pro-review-price-specs\">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185462/microsoft-surface-laptop-7th-edition-review\">Microsoft Surface Laptop</a> with a Snapdragon X Elite chip. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Value</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">All manufacturers offer configurations that cost a small fortune, but the best laptops are usually worthwhile even at their base level. Sometimes, we’ll recommend adding a little RAM, more storage, or a graphics card upgrade, but at a certain point the value proposition typically nosedives. Our goal is to find those sweet spots.<br><br>If you’re buying new and spending $1,000 or more, you should be getting a machine with performance that meets your needs, and components like a trackpad, keyboard, screen, and speakers that are good to great. Remember, you’re likely to be using this device for many hours every day. And if any of a laptop’s core features are lacking, then something else — like a great price or excellence in another area — should make up for it.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Performance</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">How much performance you <em>really</em> need may be subjective, but the more headroom you have, the more a laptop can adapt to your evolving needs and the longer it can last before things feel sluggish.<br><br>At the baseline, your laptop should be fast enough to do the things you use a laptop for, without feeling like it’s struggling on a daily basis. Any productivity laptop should be able to multitask with a bunch of browser tabs open while editing some spreadsheets or other documents. A content creation machine should be able to quickly churn through Photoshop files with lots of layers or a Premiere Pro timeline with plenty of post-processing. And a gaming laptop should be able to play the latest games with nice looking visuals and good frame rates (at least 60 fps, but ideally more on less graphically intensive games).</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Keyboard and trackpad</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">The keyboard and trackpad are the main interfaces you use with any laptop, and they should be good, even in a desktop replacement you mostly use with an external mouse and keyboard. The whole point of a laptop is you can bring your work and play with you, so you’re relying on these built-in components at some point. A laptop with a bad keyboard and trackpad might as well be a penalty box.<br><br>What makes a good keyboard and trackpad? It’s slightly subjective, but a quality keyboard should have a logical and efficient layout, enough key travel to make typing feel good and lower the risk of double-presses, and ideally be backlit for easier use in the dark. Any worthwhile laptop should have a good trackpad that easily delivers accurate clicks and swipes, with gestures for better multitasking. Trackpads often come in two styles: hinged at the top (like a piano key) or haptic (where it doesn’t actually move, and the haptic vibration you feel emulates a physical click). Either can be great when well executed.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Screen</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">In a perfect world, every laptop would have a large and bright OLED screen capable of displaying true blacks, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 or higher and refresh rate of 120Hz (or greater). But a panel like that comes with heavy costs, both in money and often in battery life. Not every laptop can have that ideal setup, but any good one should be sharp with accurate colors, enough brightness for some outdoor use (typically that means 400 nits or greater), and free of annoying anomalies like ghosting or bad off-angle viewing. Aside from OLED, Mini LEDs also make a great laptop panel that can be a big step up from the more typical IPS display, and an even bigger step up from the dim TN panels on truly cheap laptops.<br><br>Unless a touchscreen is essential to a laptop’s design (like one that converts into a tablet), they’re usually a nice bonus, rather than a requirement. Ideally they’d work with a stylus for more flexibility. MacOS laptops never have touchscreens, but they’re fairly common on Windows machines, Chromebooks, and some Linux laptops.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Design</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Laptops are meant to be thrown in bags and taken out into the world, and they should be able to withstand some wear-and-tear. We expect a solid build that doesn’t feel creaky, cheap, or have lots of flex when picked up and handled. It should have a sturdy hinge that opens easily. A less refined design can be slightly forgiven if it’s made up for by a lower price or better-than-expected performance, but these should be devices that look and feel like they’re worth the money spent.<br><br>We also take into account what a laptop is designed <em>for</em>, and if it meets those goals: an 18-inch desktop replacement is going to be heavy and less mobile; a 13-inch thin-and-light should be, well, thin and light.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Battery life</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">We expect most laptops we test to last at least eight hours of web browsing and office work. The harder a laptop works, the more power it uses, so we don&#8217;t expect to play games all day without plugging in, or render video for eight hours straight. But if a laptop can&#8217;t last a standard work day there&#8217;d better be a good reason. <br><br>We use a battery rundown test that cycles through a large number of Chrome tabs with the screen set to 200 nits that gives us a 1:1 comparison to take into account. More importantly, we record how long the battery lasts over multiple days of regular real-world use — complete with the occasional video call and some music / podcast listening. <br><br>Even if your machine is tethered to an outlet most of the time, great battery life and standby times makes life with a laptop much more flexible.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Port selection</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">We expect all laptops to have at least two USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports, preferably on separate sides for a little added convenience. They should be able to charge over USB-C, even if they also have a proprietary charge port capable of higher wattage. And while USB-A ports are a bit more nice-to-have than necessity, there’s absolutely no good reason not to have a 3.5mm headphone jack.<br><br>More powerful, more expensive laptops  (picture something over $1,000 and 14 inches or larger) should probably have an HDMI 2.1 port and card reader, or a good reason for not having them.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"QRlaQ5\">The best laptop</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>CPU:</strong> M4 (10-core) / <strong>GPU: </strong>M4 (8- or 10-core) / <strong>RAM:</strong> </em>16GB, <em>24GB, 32GB / <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / <strong>Display:</strong> 13.6-inch or 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, 2560 x 1664 or&nbsp;2880 x 1864 , 60Hz, no touch option / <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (13-inch) or 13.40 x 9.35 x <em><em>0.45 </em></em>inches (15-inch) / <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.7 pounds</em> (13-inch) or 3.3 pounds (15-inch)</em></p>\n\n<p>Apple’s new <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/raDEEQ\">M4 MacBook Air</a> is the best laptop for most people — Mac users, of course, but also the platform-agnostic or anyone who wants a no-fuss, straightforward machine that doesn’t bombard them with advertisements or bloatware. It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything. The 13-inch model starts with 16GB of RAM at $999, and it also comes in a 15-inch version for $1,199, for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis, especially at these prices.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future\">Despite losing its way around the mid-2010s</a>, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M4 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, and MagSafe charging, check. Those were also true on the previous models, but now with the M4 generation it also features the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam of the MacBook Pros, can use two external monitors with its lid open, and comes in a sky blue color (though it still looks silver in some light). And again, you get all this for <em>less</em> money than before. </p>\n\n<p>The M4 Air is a great option for just about anyone who doesn’t need video editing, heavy gaming, or more than two USB-C ports. For those that do, look to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\">14-inch MacBook Pro M4</a> — a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599. Opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port, an SD card slot, and an even better screen.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257607_M4_MacBook_Air_ADiBenedetto_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air M4 is the best laptop of 2024.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now that the M4 Air is here, Apple has fully discontinued the M3 and M2 models. You might still be able to find them at retailers like <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6602763.p?skuId=6602763\">Best Buy</a>, but they’re not worth it over the M4 unless substantially discounted. If you can afford an additional $200 on top of either the 13- or 15-inch M4 Air’s starting prices, that’ll net you 512GB of storage instead of 256GB — as well as the 10-core GPU on the 13-inch. The paltry base storage is the only remaining weak point of the MacBook Air. It’s definitely worth getting more, as the roomier SSD will make your life a little easier on a laptop that should easily last you five to seven (or even more) years.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kkIPG4\">Read our review of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review\">Apple MacBook Air M4</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Op71aj\">Best Chromebook</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core Ultra 5 115U / <strong>GPU:</strong> Intel UHD / <strong>RAM: </strong>8GB, 16GB LPDDR5 / <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB, 512GB / <strong>Display: </strong>Touch 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1200, 60Hz IPS with stylus support, 340 nits / <strong>Dimensions: </strong>12.35 x 8.84 x 0.71 inches<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Weight: </strong>3.21 pounds&nbsp;</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Acer’s Chromebook Spin is the best Chromebook we saw in 2024 — and it’s still part of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166171/chromebook-plus-gemini-acer-asus-hp\">Plus line of Chromebooks</a>, which now have Google Gemini features integrated with ChromeOS.

Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air, and the Surface Laptop mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. It’s the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night.</p>\n\n<p>The greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is whether Windows on Arm supports all the apps you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there remain outliers. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In February, Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/601205/microsoft-surface-pro-11-surface-laptop-7-intel-lunar-lake-release-date-pricing\">launched Intel Lunar Lake- based versions</a> of the Surface Laptop 7, but they’re a ridiculous $500 more expensive, and aimed solely at businesses.

It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s miles ahead of what any Copilot Plus PC can do, too, including the Intel Core Ultra laptops we’ve recently tested. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.</p>\n\n<p>There are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,700 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)</p>\n\n<p>At just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff.

Also, its battery can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge, which is good for a gaming laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Its display has been upgraded from an IPS to an OLED, it has 1TB of SSD storage and 32GB of memory, and Asus put lighting back on the lid — not a dot matrix, but a strip of LEDs spanning diagonally across.</p>\n\n<p>All that for $2,000 to $2,200 makes it hard to justify getting anything else, though you can save up to $500 if you get the RTX 4060 model. Though it has only half the RAM, it has the same great screen and build, and its frame rates are only about ten percent lower than the 4070 Zephyrus at 1080p/ultra.</p>\n\n<p>If you spend up to $700 more on the Razer Blade 14, you’ll get higher frame rates, a 240Hz screen, and upgradeable RAM — but its battery life barely hits four hours in general use, and its display doesn’t support G-Sync or HDR.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"read-our-head-to-head-review-of-the-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-and-razer-blade-14\">Read our head-to-head review of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155889/razer-blade-14-2024-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-comparison\">Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14</a>. </h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"gKwA2i\">The best dual-screen laptop</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>CPU: </strong>Intel Core Ultra 7 155U / <strong>GPU: </strong>Intel UHD (integrated) / <strong>RAM: </strong>16GB LPDDR5X / <strong>Storage:</strong> 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD / <strong>Display:</strong> 13.3-inch (2880 x 1800) 60Hz OLED touchscreen w/ stylus support / <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.78 x 8.03 x 0.63 inches / <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.95 pounds</em></em></p>\n\n<p>A dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes.</p>\n\n<p>The Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. That’s how I usually use it at home: propped up and plugged into an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement. But when I’m away, I use the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.</p>\n\n<p>The Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"VD48f8\">Read our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24140334/asus-zenbook-duo-vs-lenovo-yoga-book-9i\">head-to-head review</a> of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i and the Asus Zenbook Duo.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"T7rFe5\">The best repairable laptop</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-1340P / i7-1360P / 17-1370P, AMD Ryzen 7 7840U / <strong>GPU: </strong>Intel UHD / Iris Xe, Radeon 700M / <strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / <strong>Storage:</strong> 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, 2TB / <strong>Display:</strong> 13.5 inch IPS, 2256 x 1540, 60Hz, no touch option / <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches / <strong>Weight:</strong> 2.87 pounds</em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you want a 13-inch laptop that you can configure and assemble yourself, from the ground up, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23911664/framework-laptop-13-2023-amd-review\">Framework Laptop 13</a> is pretty much your only option. The Framework is a modular laptop that users can repair and upgrade over the length of their ownership. Everything from the RAM, to the storage, to even the processor can be upgraded down the line. The company has even come out with upgrades for parts like speakers and hinges that you can install yourself. Not only can you buy it as a prebuilt system, but you can also order it as a DIY kit, allowing you to assemble the entire thing yourself and swap out parts as you please.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Repairability aside, the Framework has a number of laudable features as a laptop itself. The display is bright and high resolution, the speakers are great, and the chassis is quite portable, coming in at under three pounds. The 3:2 aspect ratio provides a lot of room to work and is still a somewhat rare find on today’s market.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24660881/236663_Framework_Laptop_13_MChin_0006.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"The Framework logo on the Framework Laptop 13.\" title=\"The Framework logo on the Framework Laptop 13.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Framework Laptop 13 is one of very few 13-inch laptops with this degree of repairability.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge\" />\n<p>That said, I won’t pretend that this is the best 13-inch laptop you can buy.

We do run synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench, Cinebench, and 3DMark to get quantifiable comparisons between CPUs and GPUs. But, ultimately, the number-crunching is only part of it. The rest comes from actually using a laptop in our day-to-day routine, which can involve everything from Chrome tabs and Google Docs to photo and video editing and graphically-intense games — both on battery and plugged in. </p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, March 22nd:</strong> Replaced the M3 MacBook Air with the M4 MacBook Air as the overall best laptop, revised our “What we’re looking for” section, added a note about new gaming laptops launching soon, and a new “How we test laptops” section.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Buying the right laptop can be stressful. It’s likely one of the bigger tech purchases you’ll make, and there are a ludicrous number of models, sizes, form factors, and configurations to pick from. We review and test a wide swath of them here at The Verge, and we’re constantly considering what’s the best and who it’s best for.\nOur overall pick for most people has been, and continues to be, the MacBook Air — particularly, as of March 2025, the M4 model. Unless you’re forced to use Windows for specific software needs or you fancy yourself a hardcore gamer, it remains the best option for the average user who wants something portable with excellent battery life and great performance for productivity tasks.\nThough the MacBook Air is the easy recommendation for most people, that doesn’t make it the answer for everyone. What if you need more power for video or photo editing, or crunching large datasets? What if you need to run Windows? What if you play lots of games and want to take them with you? Or what if you just want something unique — or even, gasp, repairable? We’ve got some recommendations, including a Chromebook or two, a laptop with two screens, the 16-inch MacBook Pro, and the Microsoft Surface Laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite chip. \n\n\nValue\nAll manufacturers offer configurations that cost a small fortune, but the best laptops are usually worthwhile even at their base level. Sometimes, we’ll recommend adding a little RAM, more storage, or a graphics card upgrade, but at a certain point the value proposition typically nosedives. Our goal is to find those sweet spots.\nIf you’re buying new and spending $1,000 or more, you should be getting a machine with performance that meets your needs, and components like a trackpad, keyboard, screen, and speakers that are good to great. Remember, you’re likely to be using this device for many hours every day. And if any of a laptop’s core features are lacking, then something else — like a great price or excellence in another area — should make up for it.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\nHow much performance you really need may be subjective, but the more headroom you have, the more a laptop can adapt to your evolving needs and the longer it can last before things feel sluggish.\nAt the baseline, your laptop should be fast enough to do the things you use a laptop for, without feeling like it’s struggling on a daily basis. Any productivity laptop should be able to multitask with a bunch of browser tabs open while editing some spreadsheets or other documents. A content creation machine should be able to quickly churn through Photoshop files with lots of layers or a Premiere Pro timeline with plenty of post-processing. And a gaming laptop should be able to play the latest games with nice looking visuals and good frame rates (at least 60 fps, but ideally more on less graphically intensive games).\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard and trackpad\nThe keyboard and trackpad are the main interfaces you use with any laptop, and they should be good, even in a desktop replacement you mostly use with an external mouse and keyboard. The whole point of a laptop is you can bring your work and play with you, so you’re relying on these built-in components at some point. A laptop with a bad keyboard and trackpad might as well be a penalty box.\nWhat makes a good keyboard and trackpad? It’s slightly subjective, but a quality keyboard should have a logical and efficient layout, enough key travel to make typing feel good and lower the risk of double-presses, and ideally be backlit for easier use in the dark. Any worthwhile laptop should have a good trackpad that easily delivers accurate clicks and swipes, with gestures for better multitasking. Trackpads often come in two styles: hinged at the top (like a piano key) or haptic (where it doesn’t actually move, and the haptic vibration you feel emulates a physical click). Either can be great when well executed.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen\nIn a perfect world, every laptop would have a large and bright OLED screen capable of displaying true blacks, with a resolution of 2560 x 1600 or higher and refresh rate of 120Hz (or greater). But a panel like that comes with heavy costs, both in money and often in battery life. Not every laptop can have that ideal setup, but any good one should be sharp with accurate colors, enough brightness for some outdoor use (typically that means 400 nits or greater), and free of annoying anomalies like ghosting or bad off-angle viewing. Aside from OLED, Mini LEDs also make a great laptop panel that can be a big step up from the more typical IPS display, and an even bigger step up from the dim TN panels on truly cheap laptops.\nUnless a touchscreen is essential to a laptop’s design (like one that converts into a tablet), they’re usually a nice bonus, rather than a requirement. Ideally they’d work with a stylus for more flexibility. MacOS laptops never have touchscreens, but they’re fairly common on Windows machines, Chromebooks, and some Linux laptops.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nLaptops are meant to be thrown in bags and taken out into the world, and they should be able to withstand some wear-and-tear. We expect a solid build that doesn’t feel creaky, cheap, or have lots of flex when picked up and handled. It should have a sturdy hinge that opens easily. A less refined design can be slightly forgiven if it’s made up for by a lower price or better-than-expected performance, but these should be devices that look and feel like they’re worth the money spent.\nWe also take into account what a laptop is designed for, and if it meets those goals: an 18-inch desktop replacement is going to be heavy and less mobile; a 13-inch thin-and-light should be, well, thin and light.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life\nWe expect most laptops we test to last at least eight hours of web browsing and office work. The harder a laptop works, the more power it uses, so we don’t expect to play games all day without plugging in, or render video for eight hours straight. But if a laptop can’t last a standard work day there’d better be a good reason. \nWe use a battery rundown test that cycles through a large number of Chrome tabs with the screen set to 200 nits that gives us a 1:1 comparison to take into account. More importantly, we record how long the battery lasts over multiple days of regular real-world use — complete with the occasional video call and some music / podcast listening. \nEven if your machine is tethered to an outlet most of the time, great battery life and standby times makes life with a laptop much more flexible.\n\n\n\n\n\nPort selection\nWe expect all laptops to have at least two USB4 / Thunderbolt 4 ports, preferably on separate sides for a little added convenience. They should be able to charge over USB-C, even if they also have a proprietary charge port capable of higher wattage. And while USB-A ports are a bit more nice-to-have than necessity, there’s absolutely no good reason not to have a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nMore powerful, more expensive laptops  (picture something over $1,000 and 14 inches or larger) should probably have an HDMI 2.1 port and card reader, or a good reason for not having them.\n\n\n\n\nThe best laptop\nCPU: M4 (10-core) / GPU: M4 (8- or 10-core) / RAM: 16GB, 24GB, 32GB / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.6-inch or 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, 2560 x 1664 or 2880 x 1864 , 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (13-inch) or 13.40 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches (15-inch) / Weight: 2.7 pounds (13-inch) or 3.3 pounds (15-inch)\nApple’s new M4 MacBook Air is the best laptop for most people — Mac users, of course, but also the platform-agnostic or anyone who wants a no-fuss, straightforward machine that doesn’t bombard them with advertisements or bloatware. It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything. The 13-inch model starts with 16GB of RAM at $999, and it also comes in a 15-inch version for $1,199, for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis, especially at these prices.\nDespite losing its way around the mid-2010s, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M4 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, and MagSafe charging, check. Those were also true on the previous models, but now with the M4 generation it also features the same 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam of the MacBook Pros, can use two external monitors with its lid open, and comes in a sky blue color (though it still looks silver in some light). And again, you get all this for less money than before. \nThe M4 Air is a great option for just about anyone who doesn’t need video editing, heavy gaming, or more than two USB-C ports. For those that do, look to the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 — a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599. Opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port, an SD card slot, and an even better screen.\nNow that the M4 Air is here, Apple has fully discontinued the M3 and M2 models. You might still be able to find them at retailers like Best Buy, but they’re not worth it over the M4 unless substantially discounted. If you can afford an additional $200 on top of either the 13- or 15-inch M4 Air’s starting prices, that’ll net you 512GB of storage instead of 256GB — as well as the 10-core GPU on the 13-inch. The paltry base storage is the only remaining weak point of the MacBook Air. It’s definitely worth getting more, as the roomier SSD will make your life a little easier on a laptop that should easily last you five to seven (or even more) years.\nRead our review of the Apple MacBook Air M4.\nBest Chromebook\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 5 115U / GPU: Intel UHD / RAM: 8GB, 16GB LPDDR5 / Storage: 256GB, 512GB / Display: Touch 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1200, 60Hz IPS with stylus support, 340 nits / Dimensions: 12.35 x 8.84 x 0.71 inches / Weight: 3.21 pounds \nAcer’s Chromebook Spin is the best Chromebook we saw in 2024 — and it’s still part of the Plus line of Chromebooks, which now have Google Gemini features integrated with ChromeOS. It also comes with a 12-month subscription to the Google One AI premium plan, which includes 2TB of cloud storage space.\nThe Core Ultra 5 115U is slower than last gen’s Intel Core i5-1335U (the Ultra has eight cores with clock speeds up to 4.20GHz, while the Core i5 has 10 cores and goes up to 4.60GHz), but the Ultra Core has an NPU, which means it’s better suited for running AI-related tasks on-device. The new Spin Chromebook also supports the current LPDDR5 memory standard, which is faster than the previous generation in the 2023 Spin 714.\nAcer upgraded some of the connectivity port options, too. The Spin 714 now has two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, instead of two USB-C 3.2 ports, for much faster data transfer and power delivery.\nBest Snapdragon X laptop\nCPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus X1P-64-100, Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100 / GPU: Qualcomm Adreno / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB LPDDR5X (soldered) / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB / Display: 13.8-inch touchscreen LCD, 2304 x 1536 120Hz, 600 nits / Dimensions: 11.85 x 8.67 x 0.69 inches / Weight: 2.96 pounds\nOut of all the Snapdragon Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested so far, the 13- and 15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th edition stood out for their balance of performance, exceptional battery life and standby time, and quality components (120Hz screen, keyboard, webcam, trackpad, etc.). Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air, and the Surface Laptop mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. It’s the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night.\nThe greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is whether Windows on Arm supports all the apps you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there remain outliers. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam.\nIn February, Microsoft launched Intel Lunar Lake- based versions of the Surface Laptop 7, but they’re a ridiculous $500 more expensive, and aimed solely at businesses. It’s a shame, because having this hardware with Lunar Lake’s compatibility might have been an appealing prospect.\nRead our review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition.\nThe best 16-inch Windows laptop\nCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 / GPU: Radeon 890M, Radeon 880M  / RAM: 32GB, 24GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: touch 16-inch 2880 x 1800, 120Hz OLED with stylus support, 500 nits peak HDR / Dimensions: 13.92 x 9.57 x 0.47 ~ 0.51 inches / Weight: 3.21 pounds \nThe 16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 is the best-looking, best-performing Windows laptop we tested over the summer; it’s also so thin and lightweight you wouldn’t know it just by holding it! It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s miles ahead of what any Copilot Plus PC can do, too, including the Intel Core Ultra laptops we’ve recently tested. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.\nThere are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,700 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)\nAt just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff. There’s currently no other Windows laptop that offers as much performance and versatility in a 16-inch chassis for the price.\nRead our review of the Asus Zenbook S 16.\nThe best laptop for high-end gaming\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D / GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4090 / RAM: 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 17-inch IPS QHD, 240Hz display, 3ms, 300 nits, 100 percent DCI-P3 / Dimensions: 15.55 x 11.1 x 1.11 inches / Weight: 6.51 pounds\n⚠️ New models imminent\nMarch 20, 2025: While the ROG Strix Scar 17 (2023) is still a good gaming laptop, especially if you can get it on sale, a wave of laptops with Nvidia’s new 50-series mobile GPUs is expected starting in late March 2025, including 16- and 18-inch versions of the ROG Strix. Unless you absolutely can’t wait, it’s a good idea to hold off just a little while to see how the new laptops perform.\nThe ROG Strix Scar 17 X3D is big. It’s loud, it’s garish, and it’s flat-out the fastest gaming laptop we’ve tested. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen 9 79045HX3D processor, it leaves models with the same top-tier RTX 4090 graphics card and Intel’s fastest CPUs in the dust. It can run many of today’s AAA titles at 1440p with triple-digit frame rates.\nThe Scar 17 X3D has a 17-inch 2560 x 1440 240Hz screen with G-Sync, oodles of ports, a pleasant keyboard, and RGB galore. At over six and a half pounds and 17 inches on the diagonal, it’s your classic high-performance, barely portable gaming laptop.\nIts webcam is potato, battery life is exactly as bad as you’d expect from everything we just listed, and it’s expensive, but for now this is the high-water mark for gaming laptops.\nFor more down-to-earth performance and price, you can also get the ROG Strix Scar 17 with an RTX 4070 for about $2,200 or with an RTX 4080 for about $2,900.\nRead our Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 X3D review.\nThe best MacBook for photo and video editing\nCPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / GPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / RAM: 24GB or 48GB (M4 Pro),  36GB – 128 GB (M4 Max) / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 14.2 / 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR, 3024 x 1964 / 3456 x 2234, adaptive refresh up to 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 (14-inch) / 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (16-inch) / Weight: 3.5 / 4.7 pounds (M4 Pro), 3.6 / 4.8 pounds (M4 Max) \nIf you need more power for intensive creative work — like 3D rendering and working with ultra-high-resolution photos and video — the MacBook Pro is your best bet. Both the 14- and 16-inch models are available with powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max processors. There’s also a 14-inch Pro with a standard M4 processor, and while it’s a formidable step up from the MacBook Air as an everyman’s “pro” laptop, the M4 Pro and Max processors still outclass it in performance.\nProcessors aside, the MacBook Pro has remained largely unchanged since 2021. It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 16-inch, but aside from the very lowest processor options, most configurations are available in either size, so pick whichever works for you.\nIn our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The top-of-the-line 16-inch M4 Max model easily lasted all day in our most recent testing, with no battery-saving features enabled and even keeping the screen on full-time.\nMost people who need much more power than a MacBook Air — including all but the most demanding pro photographers — will be fine with an M4 Pro model, which starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD. The M4 Pro chip can be configured with up to 48GB of memory and a 4TB SSD, at the usual absurd Apple markups, and it supports up to two external 6K displays.\nIf you absolutely need more GPU power — or more than two external monitors — you can step up to the M4 Max. The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors. The vast majority of people don’t have workloads heavy enough to notice a significant difference between the M4 Pro and M4 Max; if you do, you probably know it.\nRead our reviews of the MacBook Pro 16 M4 Pro / Max and MacBook Pro 14 M4.\nThe best 14-inch gaming laptop\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 8945 HS / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 4070 / RAM: 16GB, 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 60Hz and 120Hz, 400 nits / Dimensions: 12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 3.31 pounds\nThe Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 4070 is the most well-balanced 14-inch gaming laptop. It’s powerful enough to reach 60 frames per second on ultra graphics at its native resolution (with or without DLSS) and thin and lightweight enough without trapping too much heat in its chassis. Also, its battery can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge, which is good for a gaming laptop.\nIts display has been upgraded from an IPS to an OLED, it has 1TB of SSD storage and 32GB of memory, and Asus put lighting back on the lid — not a dot matrix, but a strip of LEDs spanning diagonally across.\nAll that for $2,000 to $2,200 makes it hard to justify getting anything else, though you can save up to $500 if you get the RTX 4060 model. Though it has only half the RAM, it has the same great screen and build, and its frame rates are only about ten percent lower than the 4070 Zephyrus at 1080p/ultra.\nIf you spend up to $700 more on the Razer Blade 14, you’ll get higher frame rates, a 240Hz screen, and upgradeable RAM — but its battery life barely hits four hours in general use, and its display doesn’t support G-Sync or HDR.\nRead our head-to-head review of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and Razer Blade 14. \nThe best dual-screen laptop\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 155U / GPU: Intel UHD (integrated) / RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X / Storage: 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD / Display: 13.3-inch (2880 x 1800) 60Hz OLED touchscreen w/ stylus support / Dimensions: 11.78 x 8.03 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 2.95 pounds\nA dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes.\nThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. That’s how I usually use it at home: propped up and plugged into an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement. But when I’m away, I use the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.\nThe Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.\nRead our head-to-head review of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i and the Asus Zenbook Duo.\nThe best repairable laptop\nCPU: Intel Core i5-1340P / i7-1360P / 17-1370P, AMD Ryzen 7 7840U / GPU: Intel UHD / Iris Xe, Radeon 700M / RAM: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / Storage: 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.5 inch IPS, 2256 x 1540, 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches / Weight: 2.87 pounds\nIf you want a 13-inch laptop that you can configure and assemble yourself, from the ground up, the Framework Laptop 13 is pretty much your only option. The Framework is a modular laptop that users can repair and upgrade over the length of their ownership. Everything from the RAM, to the storage, to even the processor can be upgraded down the line. The company has even come out with upgrades for parts like speakers and hinges that you can install yourself. Not only can you buy it as a prebuilt system, but you can also order it as a DIY kit, allowing you to assemble the entire thing yourself and swap out parts as you please. \nRepairability aside, the Framework has a number of laudable features as a laptop itself. The display is bright and high resolution, the speakers are great, and the chassis is quite portable, coming in at under three pounds. The 3:2 aspect ratio provides a lot of room to work and is still a somewhat rare find on today’s market.\nThat said, I won’t pretend that this is the best 13-inch laptop you can buy. On its own merits, it is an unremarkable system with a somewhat generic look and plasticky build, particularly compared to others in its price category. Nevertheless, the Framework’s standout feature is the unprecedented access it allows its users to replace and repair its parts. We’d love to see more companies make that kind of commitment to sustainable design.\nRead our Framework Laptop 13 review.\nThe best laptop under $400\nCPU: Intel Core i3-1215U / GPU: Intel UHD / RAM: 8GB / Storage: 128GB, 256GB UFS / Display: 14-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 60Hz, non-touch / Dimensions: 12.9 x 8.4 x 0.74 inches / Weight: 3.17 pounds\nThe Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 is the least expensive laptop with Google’s new Plus certification. At around $400 for a Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it’s the baseline Chromebook you should consider if you can’t spend any more.\nIt’s so easy to get a bad Chromebook at this price, so it’s a relief that the Chromebook Plus CX34 is so good. Not only does it have respectable internals, but the 1080p screen and 1080p webcam are good for the price, the keyboard is great, and the trackpad is fine, if a bit stiff. Battery life is decent, too, and like all Plus Chromebooks, it comes with 10 years of software updates. You can spend more on a laptop, and you probably should, but don’t buy a Chromebook less powerful than this one.\nRead our review of the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34.\nHow we test laptops\nJust like everything The Verge reviews, our laptop testing is primarily based on real-world use. We do run synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench, Cinebench, and 3DMark to get quantifiable comparisons between CPUs and GPUs. But, ultimately, the number-crunching is only part of it. The rest comes from actually using a laptop in our day-to-day routine, which can involve everything from Chrome tabs and Google Docs to photo and video editing and graphically-intense games — both on battery and plugged in. \nUpdate, March 22nd: Replaced the M3 MacBook Air with the M4 MacBook Air as the overall best laptop, revised our “What we’re looking for” section, added a note about new gaming laptops launching soon, and a new “How we test laptops” section.","summary":"Buying the right laptop can be stressful.
