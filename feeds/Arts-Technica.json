In one overclocking forum thread, a seasoned expert noted that Intel's Core Ultra 200S spreader (IHS) needs to be heated above 165° C for the indium (transfer material) to loosen. But then the glue holding the IHS is also loose at this temperature, and there is only 1.5–2 millimeters of space between IHS and surface-mounted components, so it's easy for that metal IHS to slide off and take out a vital component with it. It's quite the Saturday afternoon hobby.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kevin Purdy\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/now-the-overclock-curious-can-buy-a-delidded-amd-9800x3d-with-a-warranty/#comments","content":"\n            CPUs ready to blast past their limits can be had with a warranty, for a premium.\n          ","contentSnippet":"CPUs ready to blast past their limits can be had with a warranty, for a premium.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/now-the-overclock-curious-can-buy-a-delidded-amd-9800x3d-with-a-warranty/","categories":["Gaming","Tech","AMD","AMD Ryzen","amd ryzen 9800X3D","decapping","delidding","der8auer","overclocking","Ryzen 9800X3D","thermal grizzly"],"isoDate":"2025-02-27T18:51:43.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Beth Mole\n        ","title":"Doctors report upticks in severe brain dysfunction among kids with flu","link":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/the-flu-may-be-attacking-more-childrens-brains-than-usual-this-year/","pubDate":"Thu, 27 Feb 2025 18:00:52 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Doctors around the US have anecdotally reported an uptick of children critically ill with the flu developing severe, life-threatening neurological complications, which can be marked by seizures, delirium, hallucinations, decreased consciousness, lethargy, personality changes, and abnormalities in brain imaging.</p>\n<p>It's long been known that the seasonal flu can cause such devastating complications in some children, many with no underlying medical conditions.
