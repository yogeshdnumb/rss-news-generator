(Here's a good video explainer on the subject.) This fact helps to explain how a US government-owned \"moored passive acoustic recorder\" was able to hear and record the 2023 implosion of the doomed Titan submersible—even though the recorder was 900 miles away from the dive site.\nThat implosion, during an attempted dive to the wreckage of the Titanic, killed five people, including Stockton Rush, the CEO of the company that built and operated the Titan.\nThe implosion audio was just released publicly by the US Coast Guard's Titan Marine Board of Investigation, which has been investigating the disaster in enormous detail. As part of that investigation, the Coast Guard obtained the audio from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), part of the US Department of Commerce.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Nate Anderson\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/from-900-miles-away-the-us-government-recorded-audio-of-the-titan-sub-implosion/#comments","content":"\n            The implosion took milliseconds, but its echoes lasted far longer.\n          ","contentSnippet":"The implosion took milliseconds, but its echoes lasted far longer.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/from-900-miles-away-the-us-government-recorded-audio-of-the-titan-sub-implosion/","categories":["Science","implosion","NOAA","submersible","Titan"],"isoDate":"2025-02-12T21:44:48.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jon Brodkin\n        ","title":"“Largest data breach in US history”: Three more lawsuits try to stop DOGE","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/largest-data-breach-in-us-history-three-more-lawsuits-try-to-stop-doge/","pubDate":"Wed, 12 Feb 2025 21:31:54 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>The US DOGE Service's access to the private data of ordinary Americans and federal employees is being challenged in several lawsuits filed this week.</p>\n<p>Three new complaints seek court orders that would stop the data access and require the deletion of unlawfully accessed data.
