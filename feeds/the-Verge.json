But the same week, the company delayed the start of preorders due to concerns over <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates\">President Donald Trump’s new tariffs</a>. Here’s the company’s statement, sent to <em>The Verge</em>&nbsp;by Eddie Garcia on behalf of Nintendo:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.

The following chart summarizes when preorders open; however, you can also find additional preorder details — including landing pages for the console, accessories, and games — in the retailer sections below.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table\"><table><thead><tr><th>Retailer</th><th>Online Preorders</th><th>Preorder Configurations</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nintendo</td><td>Invitation-only</td><td>Nintendo Switch 2 / Mario Kart World Bundle</td></tr><tr><td>Walmart</td><td>12AM ET on April 24th</td><td>Nintendo Switch 2 / Mario Kart World Bundle</td></tr><tr><td>Target</td><td>12AM ET on April 24th</td><td>Nintendo Switch 2 / Mario Kart World Bundle</td></tr><tr><td>Best Buy</td><td>12AM ET on April 24th</td><td>Nintendo Switch 2 / Mario Kart World Bundle</td></tr><tr><td>GameStop</td><td>11AM ET on April 24th</td><td>Nintendo Switch 2 / Mario Kart World Bundle</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>TBD</td><td>Nintendo Switch 2 / Mario Kart World Bundle</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"qNz1cS\">How to preorder via Nintendo</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As expected, one of the few confirmed retailers right now is the <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/\">My Nintendo Store</a>, which comes with a string of eligibility requirements — one of which requires you to register your interest in advance. To do so, you’ll need to sign in with your Nintendo account and choose which console configuration you prefer (and which accessories). Then, you’ll receive an invitation email when it’s time to buy it, assuming you’ve satisfied several other conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of right now, the reservation process is limited to Nintendo account holders in the US and Canada who are at least 18 years old. Invitations will be valid for 72 hours and will be “prioritized on a first-come, first-served basis,” according to Nintendo; you’ll also need to have purchased a Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months and have logged 50 hours of gameplay on the original Switch as of April 2nd, 2025, to be eligible. What’s more, you must have opted in to <em>share</em> gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so <a href=\"https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy\">in the privacy section</a> when logged into your account).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. Unsurprisingly, the invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you used while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, with the first batch of invitations going out on May 8th.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Additional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"how-to-preorder-at-best-buy\">How to preorder at Best Buy</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thankfully, if Nintendo’s strict requirements are an issue, the <a href=\"https://corporate.bestbuy.com/2025/nintendo-switch-2/\">preorder process at Best Buy</a> appears to be far more straightforward. Once preorders <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/video-games/nintendo/pcmcat1742407305710.c?id=pcmcat1742407305710\">start at 12AM on April 24th</a>, Best Buy will open preorders via its Best Buy app and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo/nintendo-switch/pcmcat1476977522176.c\">BestBuy.com</a>. What’s more, most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup, signaling a welcome return to a more old-school, midnight release schedule we last saw prior to the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Details are sparse beyond that; however, My Best Buy Plus and Total members can land a $20 certificate for every $150 they spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear, which is a nice perk for members of Best Buy’s premium loyalty program. That privilege will <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/best-buy-membership/pcmcat1679668833285.c\">run you at least $49.99 a year</a>, though both membership tiers will also grant you access to exclusive discounts, free two-day shipping, and other perks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of writing, we’re unsure whether the retailer intends to implement a queue system, as it did with the PlayStation 5 release. In the meantime, we recommend <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo/nintendo-notifications/pcmcat1736965129196.c\">signing up to receive notifications</a> regarding the Switch 2 and keeping an eye on Best Buy’s respective landing pages for the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-system-multi/6614313.p\">standalone console</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-multi/6614325.p\"><em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"how-to-preorder-at-walmart\">How to preorder at Walmart</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walmart hasn’t dished out many details regarding the Switch 2 launch via its public channels, but company spokesperson Leigh Stidham tells <em>The Verge</em> that the retailer plans to open preorders at 12AM ET on April 24th.

Some Chinese companies aren’t waiting to see. Anbernic, which makes <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/games/630797/a-game-boy-for-pirates-titw\">excellent and controversial Nintendo Game Boy clones</a>, is already suspending US shipments indefinitely.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all orders&nbsp;shipping from China to the United States starting today,” <a href=\"https://anbernic.com/pages/shipping-policy\">writes Anbernic.</a> “We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse, which are currently not affected by import duties and can be purchased with confidence.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No, Anbernic didn’t set up a brand-new US warehouse in response to tariffs — it’s been an option on its storefront for some time. Generally, Anbernic begins by drop-shipping each new handheld from China directly to buyers’ homes after they’re introduced, then stockpiles additional units in US warehouses for faster ship times. Anbernic lets buyers pick which warehouse they prefer on its checkout page.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7380025725925068075\" data-video-id=\"7380025725925068075\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@verge\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?refer=embed\">@verge</a> <p>This amazing knockoff GBA SP comes stuffed with software piracy. <a title=\"gameboy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gameboy?refer=embed\">#gameboy</a> <a title=\"gaming\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gaming?refer=embed\">#gaming</a> <a title=\"nostolgia\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nostolgia?refer=embed\">#nostolgia</a> <a title=\"techtok\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/techtok?refer=embed\">#techtok</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - The Verge\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7380025738805725994?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; The Verge</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of last week, Anbernic had <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1k1ikq0/is_it_safe_to_order_from_anbernic_at_this_point/#lightbox\">already begun suggesting</a> that US buyers pick its US warehouse because “orders shipped to the United States may be subject to high customs duties,” asking customers to “take this potential risk into account when making your purchase decisions.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But now, the company is suspending those shipments entirely — similarly to how acclaimed retro game scaler maker <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/651007/retrotink-us-shipments-suspended-trump-tariffs\">RetroTINK suspended shipments not just because of tariffs</a>, but “due to lack of guidance on how tariffs will be collected.” I checked: while you can still add a Anbernic handheld to your US cart from a Chinese warehouse, the company offers plenty of warnings and won’t let you purchase it from there.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/chrome_feBzRbspQh.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=17.479616306954,0,65.040767386091,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"“Shipping not available.” | Image: Anbernic, Sean Hollister / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Anbernic, Sean Hollister / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One reason for Anbernic’s popularity is that its retro handhelds are cheap, typically around $70 for the newest models. (Some also do an excellent job emulating the look and feel of classic Nintendo handhelds, as you can see in my videos above and below.) But those low prices are now completely under threat by Trump’s tariffs and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/642601/donald-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-shein-temu\">removal of the de minimis exemption for cheap Chinese goods</a>. It’s not clear if or how companies like Anbernic could afford to resume shipments, should those tariffs actually take hold.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the time being, Anbernic handhelds are also still available in the US via third-party sellers like Amazon — which I’ve always found surprising given that those ones typically come with Nintendo, Sega and Sony ROMs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://retrohandhelds.gg/tariffs/\"><em>Retro Handhelds</em> has a handy regularly updated page</a> keeping track of handheld tariffs; so far, Anbernic is the only one to suspend US shipments entirely.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7482035903288905003\" data-video-id=\"7482035903288905003\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@verge\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?refer=embed\">@verge</a> <p>A Game Boy for pirates?

Typically, would-be pirates would need to buy an SD card filled with pirated games or fill that SD card on a PC, but these Anbernics make downloading games as easy as downloading songs used to be. <a title=\"gaming\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gaming?refer=embed\">#gaming</a> <a title=\"gameboy\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gameboy?refer=embed\">#gameboy</a> <a title=\"nostalgia\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nostalgia?refer=embed\">#nostalgia</a> <a title=\"tech\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tech?refer=embed\">#tech</a> <a title=\"techtok\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/techtok?refer=embed\">#techtok</a> <a title=\"todayimtoyingwith\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/todayimtoyingwith?refer=embed\">#todayimtoyingwith</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - The Verge\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7482036005818698538?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; The Verge</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"How much will Trump’s threatened 245 percent tariffs truly impact Chinese goods and the prices we pay in the US? Some Chinese companies aren’t waiting to see. Anbernic, which makes excellent and controversial Nintendo Game Boy clones, is already suspending US shipments indefinitely.\n“Due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all orders shipping from China to the United States starting today,” writes Anbernic. “We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse, which are currently not affected by import duties and can be purchased with confidence.”\nNo, Anbernic didn’t set up a brand-new US warehouse in response to tariffs — it’s been an option on its storefront for some time. Generally, Anbernic begins by drop-shipping each new handheld from China directly to buyers’ homes after they’re introduced, then stockpiles additional units in US warehouses for faster ship times. Anbernic lets buyers pick which warehouse they prefer on its checkout page.\n\n \n @verge \nThis amazing knockoff GBA SP comes stuffed with software piracy. #gameboy #gaming #nostolgia #techtok \n ♬ original sound – The Verge \n  \n\n\nAs of last week, Anbernic had already begun suggesting that US buyers pick its US warehouse because “orders shipped to the United States may be subject to high customs duties,” asking customers to “take this potential risk into account when making your purchase decisions.” \nBut now, the company is suspending those shipments entirely — similarly to how acclaimed retro game scaler maker RetroTINK suspended shipments not just because of tariffs, but “due to lack of guidance on how tariffs will be collected.” I checked: while you can still add a Anbernic handheld to your US cart from a Chinese warehouse, the company offers plenty of warnings and won’t let you purchase it from there.\nOne reason for Anbernic’s popularity is that its retro handhelds are cheap, typically around $70 for the newest models. (Some also do an excellent job emulating the look and feel of classic Nintendo handhelds, as you can see in my videos above and below.) But those low prices are now completely under threat by Trump’s tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption for cheap Chinese goods. It’s not clear if or how companies like Anbernic could afford to resume shipments, should those tariffs actually take hold.\nFor the time being, Anbernic handhelds are also still available in the US via third-party sellers like Amazon — which I’ve always found surprising given that those ones typically come with Nintendo, Sega and Sony ROMs.\nRetro Handhelds has a handy regularly updated page keeping track of handheld tariffs; so far, Anbernic is the only one to suspend US shipments entirely.\n\n \n @verge \nA Game Boy for pirates?
