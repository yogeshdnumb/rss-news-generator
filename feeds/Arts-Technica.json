Such a concept found universal appeal among US drivers, according to a study by a market research company. But simplicity is key: The moment it gets difficult to register or use such an app, interest wanes and people prefer to pay for things the older-fashioned ways, DriveResearch found.\nFor instance, there was a high level of desire to be guided through the process of entering one's billing or credit card info into an in-car payment app. Seven in 10 participants said that they'd want such a thing to happen when the car is being delivered and while they're still in the \"new car\" mindset.\nBut most don't want to do that at a dealership: 77 percent also said they would prefer to register for in-car payments at home, via the phone or a computer, with only 67 percent wanting to use the car's infotainment screen and just over half (53 percent) saying it would be OK to use the automaker's connected car app.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jonathan M.
