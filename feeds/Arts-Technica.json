The headliner for this release is support for ARM64EC, the application binary interface (ABI) used for Arm apps in Windows 11, but the release notes say that the release contains \"over 6,000 individual changes\" produced over \"a year of development effort.\"\nARM64EC allows developers to mix Arm and x86-compatible code—if you're making an Arm-native version of your app, you can still allow the use of more obscure x86-based plugins or add-ons without having to port everything over at once. Wine 10.0 also supports ARM64X, a different type of application binary file that allows ARM64EC code to be mixed with older, pre-Windows 11 ARM64 code.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Andrew Cunningham\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/wine-10-0-released-adding-linux-compatibility-for-arm-windows-apps/#comments","content":"\n            Wine compatibility layer is the heart of many Windows app translation projects.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Wine compatibility layer is the heart of many Windows app translation projects.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/wine-10-0-released-adding-linux-compatibility-for-arm-windows-apps/","categories":["Tech","asahi linux","Linux","Windows","Wine"],"isoDate":"2025-01-22T20:25:08.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jon Brodkin\n        ","title":"Trump admin fires security board investigating Chinese hack of large ISPs","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-admin-fires-homeland-security-advisory-boards-blaming-agendas/","pubDate":"Wed, 22 Jan 2025 20:08:47 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>The Department of Homeland Security has terminated all members of advisory committees, including one that has been investigating a major Chinese hack of large US telecom firms.</p>\n<p>\"The Cyber Safety Review Board—a Department of Homeland Security investigatory body stood up under a Biden-era cybersecurity executive order to probe major cybersecurity incidents—has been cleared of non-government members as part of a DHS-wide push to cut costs under the Trump administration, according to three people familiar with the matter,\" <a href=\"https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/01/dhs-cyber-review-board-cleaned-out-trump-move-eliminate-misuse-resources/402386/\">NextGov/FCW reported yesterday</a>.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25500093-dhs-advisory-boards-termination-letter/\">memo</a> sent Monday by DHS Acting Secretary Benjamine Huffman said that in order to \"eliminate[e] the misuse of resources and ensur[e] that DHS activities prioritize our national security, I am directing the termination of all current memberships on advisory committees within DHS, effective immediately.

The company claims the model performs at levels comparable to OpenAI's o1 simulated reasoning (SR) model on several math and coding benchmarks.\nAlongside the release of the main DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1 models, DeepSeek published six smaller \"DeepSeek-R1-Distill\" versions ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion parameters.
