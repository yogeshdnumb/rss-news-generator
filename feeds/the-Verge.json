The company says existing users can continue to use the service for 45 days without any charges, giving them time to find an alternate broadband provider, according to CNET.\nNew York originally passed the Affordable Broadband Act in 2021, but the law was stalled for several years by pushbacks and legal challenges from broadband lobbying groups. Last December, the US Supreme Court declined to intervene, allowing the law to finally come into effect this month.\nIt follows Congress’ decision not to continue funding the federal Affordable Connectivity Program last year, which started during the covid-19 pandemic and offered discounts of up to $30 per month on home internet for qualifying households.\nThe law requires internet providers with over 20,000 customers to offer two affordable broadband plans to low-income households that qualify for social assistance benefits like Medicaid or the National School Lunch Program. One plan offers download speeds of at least 25Mbps for no more than $15 per month, while the other boosts that to speeds of up to 200Mbps at a maximum of $20 per month.\nAT&T’s Internet Air service offered New York residents download speeds of 40 to 140Mbps (which was temporarily slowed when the company’s 5G network was busy) for $55 per month, or $60 for those not opting for autopay. Instead of complying with the new law and offering Internet Air at a discount, AT&T has instead ended its home internet services in New York. The company also doesn’t offer home internet over fiber or DSL in the state.\n“While we are committed to providing reliable and affordable internet service to customers across the country, New York’s broadband law imposes harmful rate regulations that make it uneconomical for AT&T to invest in and expand our broadband infrastructure in the state,” the company said in statements provided to CNET and Ars Technica.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24346159/att-new-york-affordable-broadband-act-5g","isoDate":"2025-01-17T21:50:09.000Z"},{"title":"Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd returns as CEO amid a dating app decline","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24346171/bumble-whitney-wolfe-herd-ceo-dating-apps","pubDate":"2025-01-17T21:46:21.000Z","author":"Jay Peters","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"The Wall Street Journal’s 2024 The Future Of Everything Festival\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwpdBR6-KhW2j45R4Sa4Al31k2U=/1x0:5350x3566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73853635/2153998487.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Photo by Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"DtSxs5\">Bumble founder and executive chair Whitney Wolfe Herd, who <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23948830/bumble-founder-ceo-whitney-wolfe-herd-stepping-down\">stepped down as CEO</a> at the beginning of 2024, <a href=\"https://ir.bumble.com/news/news-details/2025/Bumble-Inc.-Announces-Leadership-Transition-to-Drive-its-Next-Phase-of-Transformation/default.aspx\">is returning to the post in mid-March</a>.

Some of it was recorded inside planes flying nearby, and many flights were diverted around the debris field, or delayed until all the fragments touched down.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said it had “briefly slowed and diverted planes around the area where space debris was falling,” according to Reuters.\nThe 7th test flight of Starship was at least a partial success, marking the second time SpaceX successfully caught the Super Heavy booster with its launch tower.
