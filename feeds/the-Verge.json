And while the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day, you can still find steep savings on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-2-TwoCameras-White/dp/B0BWX39R5W/\">cheap security cameras</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-41mm-Smartwatch/dp/B0D912YVPQ/\">smartwatches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Ears-Ultra-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B0DCJ9N5XR\">portable speakers</a>, and loads of other tech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As is typical of Amazon, the retailer has <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/events/bigspringsale/\">already dropped a handful of deals</a> in the run-up to the event, many of which we anticipate will stick around through the seven-day promo period.

Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C.

The 2023 model sports USB-C charging, a 10.1-inch, 1080p display, and 3GB of RAM, which is plenty if all you’re doing is streaming or browsing.

Amazon’s Big Spring Sale kicks off on Tuesday, March 25th, and runs through Monday, March 31st, bringing with it a slew of discounts on gardening supplies, bedding, grilling essentials, and other springtime favorites. And while the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day, you can still find steep savings on cheap security cameras, smartwatches, portable speakers, and loads of other tech.\nAs is typical of Amazon, the retailer has already dropped a handful of deals in the run-up to the event, many of which we anticipate will stick around through the seven-day promo period. Most deals don’t require you to cough up $14.99 a month for a Prime subscription, either, making it a great time to snag a tried-and-tested Verge favorite.\nWe’ll be digging into all the deals and discounts next week; however, in the meantime, you can peruse a selection of the best early deals below, all of which have been handpicked and tested by a Verge staffer at one point or another.\nFeatured deals\nOther deal recommendations\nThe Beats Studio Pro are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $179.95 ($170 off), which remains one of the best prices we’ve seen. Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C. Plus, unlike most noise-canceling headphones, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. Read our review.\nIf you prefer a pair of noise-canceling earbuds that support native software features on both iOS and Android, the Beats Studio Buds Plus are available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $130 ($40 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Yes, their lack of wireless charging and in-ear detection stings a bit at their typical list price, but their see-through design is slick enough that the shortcomings are (almost) forgivable. Read our review.\nThe Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e — aka, the best-sounding wireless headphones you can buy — are available at Amazon starting at $296.71 (about $102 off), or from Bower & Wilkins or Best Buy for $319.99 ($80 off). The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5. Read our review.\nAmazon’s ad-supported Fire HD 10 tablet is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy right now with 32GB of storage starting at $94.99 ($45 off), or about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. The 2023 model sports USB-C charging, a 10.1-inch, 1080p display, and 3GB of RAM, which is plenty if all you’re doing is streaming or browsing. Just be aware that, like all of Amazon’s budget-minded tablets, it’s really focused on serving up Amazon content at every turn.\nJBL’s Charge 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in multiple colors starting at $119.95 ($60 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker since July. We’re not huge fans of the oversized JBL logo, but the powerful Bluetooth speaker hits all the right marks when it comes to functionality and performance, offering an impressive 20 hours of battery life and a built-in USB-A port that lets you top off your phone while listening to music.\nDespite the fact the Sonos app has been a bit of a debacle as of late, I have few qualms about recommending the Sonos Era 100 for $199 ($50 off), its current price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront. It’s a great smart speaker with stereo sound, privacy-conscious microphone controls, and support for both Bluetooth and line-in connections. It can also connect to Spotify and every other music service you can think of and supports AirPlay 2, letting you stream content from Apple devices. Read our review.\nRing’s latest Indoor Cam is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and The Home Depot for $39.99 ($20 off), matching its second-best price to date. The 1080p security camera boasts all the same features as the prior model — including two-way talk, color night vision, and a built-in siren — only it’s equipped with a redesigned mount that makes it easier to adjust. That said, you’ll need a Ring Protect Plan ($4.99 a month / $49.99 a year) to share or view video recordings.\nFor a limited time, Garmin’s InReach Mini 2 is available at Amazon starting at $293.89 (about $106 off), an all-time low. The rugged, palm-sized satellite communicator might seem a little unnecessary given many recent phones now support satellite messaging, but the subscription-based gadget is still great for texting, sharing your location in the backcountry, and triggering an SOS alert in the event of an emergency.

The tiny, orb-shaped smart speaker features onboard microphones and produces good sound for its size, making it a solid option for listening to music, issuing smart home commands, checking the weather, and making other various Alexa requests.
