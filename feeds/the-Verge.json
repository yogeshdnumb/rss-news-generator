The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.</p>\n<p id=\"rLWRaU\">The last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. In fact, we’d recommend you buy the base 10th-gen iPad instead, which is only $10 more than the lowest price we’re currently seeing for the 2021 iPad. That said, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91TLNJ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/d9a5ad0w0njv4\">Best Buy</a> are selling the step-up 256GB variant for $399.99 ($80 off).

The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Air are also starting to see substantial price reductions, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s new iPad Mini.\n\n\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the cheapo ninth-gen iPad of 2021 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M2 and M4 chips.\n\n\nThe best iPad (2021) deals\nAnnounced alongside the iPhone 13 way back in 2021, the ninth-gen iPad is Apple’s aging entry-level tablet, one that’s still great at carrying out everyday tasks despite having been discontinued. The ninth-gen model originally started at $329 with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage, which arguably makes the newer 10th-gen model the better deal if you don’t need a home button or a headphone jack, as it now starts at $349 and is often on sale for even less.\nThe last-gen iPad has been receiving a steep discount for quite a while, but it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find in most configurations. In fact, we’d recommend you buy the base 10th-gen iPad instead, which is only $10 more than the lowest price we’re currently seeing for the 2021 iPad. That said, Amazon and Best Buy are selling the step-up 256GB variant for $399.99 ($80 off). That’s not the best deal we’ve seen, considering it’s been as low as $280 before, but that’s still a bit cheaper than the comparable 2022 model.\nA last-gen model is still worth considering\nThe last-gen iPad uses an A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP wide-angle camera with Center Stage, a feature designed to keep you framed up and centered while on video calls. The tablet also carries over a number of features from its predecessor, such as the 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a smart connector for connecting a smart keyboard.\n\n\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\nAlthough the newer 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022, it’s still an excellent tablet — one we consider to be the best value for most people (once Apple dropped its price). The latest iPad modernizes the design with a switch to USB-C, uniform bezels with no home button, a side power button with a fingerprint sensor, and a larger display, but it eliminates the 3.5mm headphone jack.\nIn the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Amazon and Walmart in select colors for $299 ($50 off), which is $50 more than its all-time low. Amazon and B&H Photo are selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for $469 ($30 off), which is about $60 more than its best price to date. \n\n\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category should appreciate the upgrades.\n\n\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\nRight now, you can get the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi at Amazon and Best Buy for $399 ($100 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen. You can also get the 256GB variant at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $499 ($100 off), which is its best price to date.\n\n\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\nThe 2024 iPad Air doesn’t feature any groundbreaking changes compared to the 2022 release, but notably, there is now a 13-inch configuration in addition to a base 11-inch model. Apple also added Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, which enables the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the newer iPad Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and both previous-gen Magic Keyboards, too. The 11-inch iPad Air starts at $599, while the comparable 13-inch model starts at $799.\n\n\nDeals for the 2024 iPad Air started to appear before the latest model even hit store shelves. Right now, you can pick up the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi at Amazon and B&H Photo for $549 ($50 off), which is $50 more than its all-time low.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n\n\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\n\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\n\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, it’s only on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $383.28 (about $15 off) — a far cry from its all-time low of $329. The GPS-equipped model, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart in the 46mm variant for $411.91 (about $17 off), while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at $479.36 (about $20 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra.
