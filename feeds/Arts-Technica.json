It's not yet deemed a clinical addiction, but it does share some symptoms with addiction and substance abuse disorders. And according to a new paper published in the journal PLoS ONE, someone who exhibits PSMU is also more likely to believe in—and share—fake news online, contributing to the rampant spread of misinformation that is the bane of the 21st-century Internet.\n\"If someone struggles with a substance dependency, it's the decision-making process in their brain where they have difficulties stopping,\" co-author Dar Meshi of Michigan State University told Ars. \"They take their drug and have a negative outcome: get a DUI or crash their car. Most people learn from a bad outcome and don't do it again, but someone with a substance use disorder continues to do that action.\"\nIn the case of PSMU, someone might feel bad if they are unable to access social media for an extended period (withdrawal), or their use of social media might lead to losing a job, poor grades, or mental health issues.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/social-media-addicts-more-likely-to-believe-fake-news/#comments","content":"\n            People with high score on problematic social media use are more likely to like and share fake news.\n          ","contentSnippet":"People with high score on problematic social media use are more likely to like and share fake news.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/social-media-addicts-more-likely-to-believe-fake-news/","categories":["Science","addiction","cognitive bias","disinformation","misinformation","problematic social media use","psychology","social media"],"isoDate":"2025-05-08T14:54:42.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Benj Edwards\n        ","title":"Trump admin to roll back Biden’s AI chip restrictions","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/trump-admin-to-roll-back-bidens-ai-chip-restrictions/","pubDate":"Thu, 08 May 2025 14:37:38 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced plans to rescind and replace a Biden-era rule regulating the export of high-end AI accelerator chips worldwide, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-07/trump-to-rescind-global-chip-curbs-amid-ai-restrictions-debate\">Bloomberg</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-administration-will-rescind-biden-era-ai-chip-export-curbs-bloomberg-news-2025-05-07/\">Reuters</a> reported.</p>\n<p>A Department of Commerce spokeswoman told Reuters that officials found the previous framework \"overly complex, overly bureaucratic, and would stymie American innovation\" and pledged to create \"a much simpler rule that unleashes American innovation and ensures American AI dominance.\"</p>\n<p>The Biden administration <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/biden-administration-puts-quotas-on-global-ai-chip-sales/\">issued</a> the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion in January during its final week in office.
