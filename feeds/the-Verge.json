They’re being put on by over 150 different organizations, including civil rights groups, labor unions, and LGBTQ+ advocates, and span more than 1,200 locations.\nLast weekend, “Tesla Takedown” protests targeted Tesla showrooms around the country to show disapproval for Musk, its CEO, who has spearheaded an effort to carry out mass federal workforce layoffs and hollow out government agencies. As Tesla’s sales have plummeted this quarter, Musk has threatened to “go after” the company’s critics, while the FBI has created a task force to investigate individual acts of vandalism and other actions aimed at the company.\n\n\nRain or shine (mostly rain)\n— Mia Sato (@miasato.bsky.social) 2025-04-05T18:21:40.575Z\n\n\nThe scope of these protests is much broader, targeting both Trump and Musk, who the Hands Off website accuses (accurately) of “shuttering Social Security offices, firing essential workers, eliminating consumer protections, and gutting Medicaid.” The Verge’s Mia Sato is in Manhattan’s Bryant Park in New York City, where she took the above video. She told me it wasn’t clear how many people are there, but that it’s “wall to wall everywhere” despite the fact that it’s “raining here and really nasty.”\n\n\nHands off rally in Washington, DC today\n— Lauren Feiner (@laurenfeiner.bsky.social) 2025-04-05T19:58:28.578Z\n\n\nMy colleague Lauren Feiner, who attended the protest in Washington, DC, said the protest there “is very big, thousands here around the Washington monument.” She described it as “very peaceful and orderly,” with attendees listening quietly to the speakers, occasionally chanting in response. \nJessica Toman, who went to the protest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, texted the above image to me. A person posting images of the same protest on Bluesky guessed that protesters numbered in the thousands. \nIt looks like a similar story in Boston, where “thousands” are seen in this video from today:\n\n\nWOW: Thousands are currently protesting in Boston. This is just one of more than 1200 'Hands Off' protests underway today across the nation as people rise up against the Trump-Musk regime. (via Rob Way)\n— MeidasTouch (@meidastouch.com) 2025-04-05T16:06:41.143Z\n\n\nFox 9 Minneapolis-St. Paul posted aerial footage of a massive crowd gathered at the State Capitol building in St. Paul, Minnesota:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemonstrators gathered in massive numbers in Daley Plaza in Chicago, Illinois, too, where a CBS Chicago livestream showed what looked like many thousands of people streaming from one side of the street to another for many blocks while this story was being written. Protests are also taking place overseas, in cities like Berlin, Germany and London, England.\nIt’s not just major cities. Hundreds appear to have shown up to protest in cities like St. Augustine, Florida, which the US Census Bureau estimates has less than 16,000 people, and Riverhead, New York, where only about 36,000 people live. Cars honked in apparent support of a protest in Manhattan, Kansas (under 54,000 residents), according to the Bluesky user who posted this video:\n\n\n4/5/25 Manhattan, KS-a college town & home of NBAF, in Sen Marshall’s district, 5 min after it was to begin & they’re still coming!😁✊🏻💜 Proud of my Blue Dot in a red state! #manhattankansas #handsoff\n— M (@snflwr6684.bsky.social) 2025-04-05T16:43:22.728Z\n\n\nA similar scene plays out in this video, apparently taken in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, a town of fewer than 4,000 people, today:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a gallery with some more images taken by Sato, Toman, and The Verge’s Chris Welch:","summary":"People are gathering in cities all over the United States and globally to protest an “illegal, billionaire power grab” by President Donald Trump and Elon Musk.

The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.</p>\n\n<p>Tech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we test wireless earbuds</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Whether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, with earbud makers often reserving certain software tricks for their own preferred ecosystem, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Comfort</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">No matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip I can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one of your ears needs something bigger or smaller than the other.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Good sound</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Just like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, I care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music I’m listening to. I want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. I look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in my favorite songs.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Active noise cancellation</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">What was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Long battery life</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Most earbuds these days can reach between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Water resistance</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Even if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At minimum, you should be looking for earbuds that offer IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"NRILW6\">The best overall wireless earbuds</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life:</strong> 8 hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> Yes / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Foam (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Just like their predecessors, Sony’s newer WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the 1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.</p>\n\n<p>Some people found the WF-1000XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24805959/DSCF2249_Enhanced_NR.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" title=\"A photo of Sony’s WF-1000XM5 earbuds.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The WF-1000XM5 are smaller and more comfortable than their M4 predecessors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>On Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 — with substantially better noise cancellation to boot. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth, so you can pair with two devices at the same time.</p>\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SUJOO3\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23803374/sony-wf-1000xm5-earbuds-review\">Read my&nbsp;full WF-1000XM5 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"d26N53\">The best budget earbuds under $100</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>5.5<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IP54 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> LDAC, AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>When looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25406202/DSCF6918.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of new earbuds from Nothing.\" title=\"A photo of new earbuds from Nothing.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Ear (a) are Nothing’s first earbuds that aren’t only offered black or white.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>And the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point.

Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro.

They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.</p>\n\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/620706/powerbeats-pro-2-apple-heart-rate-gym-equipment\">can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment</a> when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.<br></p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257536_Powerbeats_Pro_2_AKrales_0129.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro 2 have an ear-hook design for maximum stability.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"orqrNZ\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/headphone-review/609473/powerbeats-pro-2-review-headphones-heart-rate-monitoring-wearables\">Read our full&nbsp;Powerbeats Pro 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"MzRNQU\">The best earbuds for iPhone owners</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Noise cancellation:</strong> Yes / <strong>Battery life: </strong>6<strong> </strong>hours (ANC on) / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> IPX4 / <strong>Bluetooth codecs:</strong> AAC, SBC&nbsp;/ <strong>Multipoint:</strong> No / <strong>Works best with:</strong> iOS, Windows, macOS / <strong>Ear tips:</strong> Silicone (XS, S, M, L)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>For those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23365910/apple-airpods-pro-second-generation-review\">second-gen AirPods Pro</a> bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair.

The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint.

However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds.

The market has come a long way since the early era of true wireless earbuds when we had to deal with mediocre sound quality and unreliable performance, all for the sake of ditching cables. Things are much different now. After several product generations of learned lessons, companies like Sony, Apple, Samsung, and others are releasing their most impressive earbuds to date. \nYou can get phenomenal noise cancellation and sound quality in the premium tier of earbuds if you’re willing to spend big. But those aren’t always the most important criteria for everyone: maybe you’re looking for the perfect fitness earbuds or for a set that works just as well for Zoom calls as for playing your favorite playlists and podcasts.\nTech companies are increasingly making their earbuds work best with their own products through exclusive features and functionality, so that’s another thing to consider as you shop around. If you want a perk like head-tracking spatial audio, you’ll need to use AirPods with an iPhone, Samsung buds with a Samsung phone, and so on.\nFeatured in this article\n\n\nHow we test wireless earbuds\nWhether you’re using earbuds to check out a newly-released album on Spotify, as motivation at the gym, or to tune out distractions around the office, they must deliver on the key metrics of sound quality, noise cancellation, voice call performance, and more. We spend many hours putting our picks through the paces. This includes quiet listening sessions that reveal their full detail, overall fidelity, and dynamics. We also take these buds out into the real world — on rush hour subway commutes, around busy cities, and in crowded cafes — to gauge their connection strength and determine how effectively they can quiet the world around you. We test them on video calls at work and by calling friends and family, who provide blunt feedback on how their mics sound. And importantly, with earbud makers often reserving certain software tricks for their own preferred ecosystem, we see how the earbuds fare when used across multiple platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nComfort\nNo matter how they sound, what good are earbuds if you don’t enjoy wearing them? Ears come in all shapes and sizes, so the comfort factor is highly subjective. Most of our picks include several sizes of ear tips; usually they’re silicone, but some companies use foam (or both). Again, which you like better comes down to personal preference. Silicone tips are more common, but foam can expand to fill more of your ear for a better seal. The most important tip I can offer is to try different-sized tips in each ear: you might find that one of your ears needs something bigger or smaller than the other.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood sound\nJust like with comfort, we all have our own inclinations for what we want from sound quality. Some people are bass-heads who can’t live without a thumping low end. Personally, I care more about dynamics, clarity, and definition from the music I’m listening to. I want vocals to ring through naturally and instruments to be well separated in the sound stage. I look for earbuds that can bring out the subtle details in my favorite songs.\n\n\n\n\n\nActive noise cancellation\nWhat was once a luxury feature is now the status quo. Many of our top picks include active noise cancellation to help quiet the raucous outside world. Whether you’re trying to concentrate at the office or rest while traveling, noise cancellation can be a huge help. However, some people hate the “plugged up” feeling of earbuds and prefer open-style buds that help maintain full awareness of their surroundings.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong battery life\nMost earbuds these days can reach between five and six hours of continuous battery life with ANC enabled. Some models can exceed that (and over-ear headphones tend to last much longer on a charge), but the convenience of being able to just pop your earbuds back into their case for more juice makes the tradeoff easier to live with.\n\n\n\n\n\nWater resistance\nEven if you don’t intend to use your earbuds for fitness purposes, there’s always a chance of getting caught out in the rain while wearing them. At minimum, you should be looking for earbuds that offer IPX4 water resistance. This safeguards them from splashes of water (and sweat), so they should be cut out for the hazards of daily life.\n\n\nThe best overall wireless earbuds\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Foam (XS, S, M, L)\nJust like their predecessors, Sony’s newer WF-1000XM5 earbuds have again topped our recommendations for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds. Thanks to their larger drivers, the audio quality is more detailed and dynamic than before while still retaining the warmth and clarity that made the 1000XM4 so enjoyable. Sony has also further improved its ANC and is nearing the same territory as Bose’s QC Earbuds II. These earbuds do a terrific job of eliminating background noise. Battery life can stretch to eight hours of continuous listening with noise cancellation turned on.\nSome people found the WF-1000XM4 to be bulky and uncomfortable, so this time around, Sony has managed to shrink the XM5 by 25 percent. Like before, the company includes foam-style tips that expand in your ears to create an excellent seal — and now there’s a fourth (extra small) set of tips in the box.\nOn Android phones, the 1000XM5 support Sony’s LDAC codec for higher-quality music playback. And they’re capable of dynamic head tracking spatial audio through supported video apps like Netflix. But even if you’re not using LDAC (or have an iPhone), these are up there with the very best audio-focused premium earbuds like Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 — with substantially better noise cancellation to boot. They’re also capable of multipoint Bluetooth, so you can pair with two devices at the same time.\nIt’s worth noting that there were many reports of battery issues with the 1000XM4 over time as those earbuds aged, but Sony claims to have rectified that problem with the new model by tweaking the charging algorithm.\nRead my full WF-1000XM5 review.\nThe best budget earbuds under $100\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 5.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nWhen looking at Nothing’s Ear (a) earbuds, it’s easy to focus all your attention on the catchy yellow color or their fun, super compact carrying case. But at their $99.99 price, the company’s entry-level earbuds provide a ton of features, including active noise cancellation, a low-latency mode for gaming, multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and a decent IP54 dust and water resistance rating. \nAnd the sound quality you get outperforms my usual expectations for this price point. They’re not quite on par with Nothing’s higher-end Ears, but you do get expressive, very enjoyable audio — and you can customize the EQ further in Nothing’s mobile app.\nRead my full Nothing Ear (a) impressions.\nThe best noise-canceling earbuds\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC, aptX Adaptive / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nBose’s QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are the most powerful noise-canceling earbuds on the market. Of all our top picks, they do the best job at offering peace and quiet from the cacophony of daily life and putting you in a private bubble with your music playlists or favorite podcasts.\nThe QC Ultra Earbuds are extremely similar to 2022’s QC Earbuds II in terms of design, fit, and sound. Audio quality is rich and dynamic, delivering more bass thump than, say, Apple’s AirPods Pro. And by switching to a two-piece ear tip / stabilizer fitting process, Bose’s latest flagship buds should fit a wider range of ears more comfortably. The Ultra also introduce a new Immersive Audio mode, which is Bose’s take on spatial audio.\nRead my full QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds review.\nThe best earbuds for sports and working out\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 8 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L, XL)\nAfter a long wait, Beats finally introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 in early 2025. They carry forward the signature ear hook design of past Powerbeats earbuds, but improve upon the original Powerbeats Pro in several key ways. Beats added active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode to the Pro 2; the first-generation pair lacked both. The earbuds themselves are lighter, too, and the charging case is noticeably smaller.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 also feature heart rate monitoring thanks to built-in sensors on each earbud. You might already have a fitness tracker, chest strap, or smartwatch for this purpose, but if not, you can use these with compatible apps like Nike Run Club, Runna, Ladder, Slopes, Open, Peloton, and YaoYao. The downside is that they can’t simultaneously play music and broadcast heart rate to gym equipment when paired to an iOS device, rendering the Pro 2 a better heart rate monitoring alternative for Android users than iPhone users.\n\n\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 remain rated IPX4 for water resistance. While that’s not as robust as some other fitness-focused buds, it should be sufficient to survive sweat and outdoor runs in various conditions. The earbuds still offer easy-to-use physical buttons and a dedicated volume rocker, so it’s easy to control them in the middle of a workout.\nIf you’re an iPhone owner, the Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds include Apple-only features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, auto device switching, Find My integration, and more. For Android users, Beats has an app that packs in a smaller subset of these functions. \nRead our full Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThe best earbuds for iPhone owners\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IPX4 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nFor those invested in Apple’s ecosystem, the second-gen AirPods Pro bring an appealing mix of top-notch noise cancellation and refined sound compared to the original pair. As always, they also include numerous features (spatial audio, audio sharing, automatic syncing across iCloud devices, etc.) that make them an ideal companion to the company’s other devices. They’re also the only AirPods that come with different sizes of ear tips for a customizable fit — including an extra small option.\nThe AirPods Pro have a compact case that supports wireless charging. Setting them up is as simple as holding the open case near your iPhone. The earbuds are lightweight and fit snugly in most ears. Their force sensor pinch controls are easy to get down, and with the second-gen model, Apple added swipe-based volume controls. The AirPods Pro have traditionally ranked among the best wireless earbuds when it comes to voice call quality, and the second-gen earbuds don’t disappoint. Their ANC is improved over the original model and is now right up there with Sony, and their transparency mode has gained the ability to quickly damper sudden, loud noises that might happen around you.\nWhere the AirPods Pro stand out is with their Apple-only features like head tracking for spatial audio, automatic device switching, extensive Find My support, and so on. The charging case now features a built-in speaker and a U1 chip for pinpoint location tracking, and the latest AirPods Pro have better sound and noise canceling capabilities than the original model. Plus, they retain their deep integration with Apple’s hardware ecosystem.\nIn the fall of 2024, Apple also rolled out an impressive set of hearing health features for the second-gen AirPods Pro. They’re now able to serve as clinical-grade hearing aids for people with mild to moderate hearing loss and protect your hearing in loud environments; you can even take a hearing test to assess your own level of hearing loss.\nRead my full AirPods Pro (second-gen) review.\nThe best earbuds for Samsung Galaxy phone owners\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSamsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ditch the company’s more discreet designs of the past for a stemmed style that’s similar to AirPods and any number of other wireless earbuds.

You also get simple one-tap pairing, no matter which operating system you’re using.\nThe drawback to this dual-ecosystem life is that Apple customers don’t get all the usual bells and whistles that come with AirPods or even the Beats Fit Pro; you lose out on audio sharing, head tracking spatial audio, and other tricks. Wireless charging and an ear detection sensor (for auto-pause when a bud is removed) are also MIA, which stings a bit considering the price.\nRead my full Beats Studio Buds Plus review.\nThe best earbuds for sound quality\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 7.5 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AptX Adaptive, AptX, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: Yes / Works best with: Android, iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (XS, S, M, L)\nSennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds have always sounded fantastic; that’s never been the issue. But previous models in the series have been tainted a bit by bugs, unsteady performance, and battery reliability problems. The fourth-gen pair finally gets that part right while continuing to offer tremendous, detailed sound quality that stands above nearly all competitors. They’re a joy to listen to. The active noise cancellation can’t compete with the likes of Apple, Sony, and Bose, but if you care more about lush, intricate sound, the MTW4 won’t disappoint in the slightest.\nThese earbuds come with optional wing tips to help keep them securely locked in your ears. That could prove helpful for running or when hitting the gym. Sennheiser allows for plenty of EQ customization using its mobile app, and the Momentum True Wireless 4 support a range of Bluetooth codecs, including AAC, SBC, AptX, and AptX Adaptive. Sennheiser has also promised that they’re LE Audio and Auracast-ready for when those features become more widespread.\nRead my full Momentum True Wireless 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on iPhone\nNoise cancellation: Optional / Battery life: 5 hours / Water resistance: IP54 / Bluetooth codecs: AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: iOS, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: None\nApple’s AirPods 4 come in two different versions, with a higher-priced option that includes active noise cancellation and wireless charging. But sound quality is identical on both sets, and equally as important in this case is that the same can be said of voice call clarity.\nOn the AirPods 4, there’s a new “voice isolation” feature — enabled by default — that uses machine learning both on the earbuds and your iPhone to eliminate distracting background noise on your end so that you come through clearly to whoever you’re speaking with.\nOverall call quality is excellent with the AirPods 4. And beyond that, compared to the third-gen model, you can expect upgraded audio quality (with richer bass), new ways of interacting with Siri through head movements, and yes… there’s a USB-C connector on the included charging case, as opposed to a Lightning port.\nThe AirPods still have a one-size-fits-most hard plastic form factor, so I recommend trying them before committing to a purchase. However, Apple says it used more than 50 million data points to further refine the contours and overall stability of its latest earbuds. So, if previous models worked well for you, these seem like a safe bet. The only question is whether you feel like spending a little more to gain ANC, a transparency mode, wireless charging, and a built-in speaker for Find My location tracking.\nRead my full AirPods 4 review.\nThe best earbuds for voice calls on Android\nNoise cancellation: Yes / Battery life: 6 hours (ANC on) / Water resistance: IP57 / Bluetooth codecs: Samsung seamless, AAC, SBC / Multipoint: No / Works best with: Android, Windows, macOS / Ear tips: Silicone (S, M, L)\nSony’s unconventional LinkBuds were our longtime pick for the clearest voice calls on Android, but we haven’t had the chance to review their successors. For now, the aforementioned Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are an easy-to-recommend choice. The built-in “voice pickup unit” detects the movement of your mouth to help isolate your voice from background noise and keep conversations clear.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have proven dependable for me during video chats on Google Meet, and people have been able to hear me without issue, even when I’m answering a quick call on the street.\nRead my full Galaxy Buds 3 Pro review.\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge except where specified\nUpdate, April 5th: Updated to reflect current pricing and availability, along with several new links.","summary":"It’s hard to buy a bad pair of wireless earbuds these days, and with constant discounts and deals wherever you look, now is as good of a time as any to splurge on the pair you’ve been eyeing.
