Laura from California, you shouldn’t drink that much Coca-Cola, it’s bad for your health.”\n\n\nFor years, TikTok has faced scrutiny over the ties of its parent company, ByteDance, to China, with lawmakers calling it a “national security threat” and accusing the app of sending US user data to China. But now the platform’s ban is imminent, with the Supreme Court set to hand down a decision on whether to uphold the law that would either ban TikTok or force ByteDance to divest it by January 19th.\n  @yneeky \n#tiktokban #fyp #fypシ #foryoupage \n ♬ original sound - Neeky \n  \n\n\n \n @yanxiao1003 \nNo gathering lasts forever #tiktokban #chinesespy \n ♬ See You Again - Saymon Cleiton & jhonatan Rodrigues \n  \n\n\n \n @lisandravcomedy \nAn open letter to my special Chinese Spy   #tiktokban #politicstiktok #comedy \n ♬ Carmen Habanera, classical opera(1283412) - perfectpanda \n  \n\n\n \n @cool_cammy \ni’m gonna miss my chinese spy  \n ♬ original sound - cool_cammy \n  \n\n\n \n @celestialdemon9909 \n#tiktokban \n ♬ original sound - Ancoleman9909 \n  \n\n\n \n @matcha.mix \nsometimes it’s the one who’s always been in front of you that you never notice #tiktokban #invisiblestring #lovejourney #matchamix #data #china #datinglife \n ♬ original sound - alex \n  \n\n\n \n @kozylifekiki \nTiktok ban who they can have all the info they want on me to keep tiktok from getting banned     #tiktokban \n ♬ original sound - JamieJL651","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24343063/tiktok-ban-goodbye-chinese-spy-trend","isoDate":"2025-01-13T23:14:44.000Z"},{"title":"Meta is already working on Community Notes for Threads","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342930/meta-threads-community-notes-leaks","pubDate":"2025-01-13T21:31:03.000Z","author":"Jay Peters","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"An image showing the Threads logo\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oji56j6GWPG6kH-TBXN_fyktYsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73844599/STK156_Instagram_threads_1.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Illustration: The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"5bhcXO\">Meta announced last week that it would be ditching fact-checkers in favor of X-like Community Notes, and self-described<strong> “</strong>leaker” Alessandro Paluzzi <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@alex193a/post/DExryqXSehq\">shared screenshots on Monday</a> showing what the feature might look like in Threads.</p>\n<p id=\"VVGP0g\">Based on the screenshots, it appears you’ll be able to start the process of writing a Community Note from the three-dots menu on a post, which is where you can already access features like muting an account or reporting a post.

Some are even asking questions to Chinese users, such as “What are some popular memes in China?”\nScreenshot: The Verge\n  \n\nRedNote, which launched in 2013 as a shopping-focused app, now has more than 300 million monthly active users and surpassed $1 billion in profit last year, according to Bloomberg. \nLast week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over whether to uphold the law that will ban TikTok or force its China-based owner, ByteDance, to sell it to an American company. The Supreme Court has until January 19th to issue a decision. \nTikTok users may be flocking to RedNote now, but the ban also implicates other Chinese-owned apps, including RedNote, WeChat, and the other apps run by ByteDance like Lemon8 and CapCut.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342986/rednote-xiaohongshu-chinese-social-media-app-tiktok-ban","isoDate":"2025-01-13T21:28:04.000Z"},{"title":"Nintendo’s Alarmo will be available for everyone starting in March","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date","pubDate":"2025-01-13T20:33:38.000Z","author":"Andrew Webster","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"A photo of Nintendo’s Alarmo alarm clock.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/toRPNlT6mqO1L9OoOqglNUvzzm4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73844497/DSC_0992.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"NQH9Ff\">Another day, another announcement from Nintendo that isn’t <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks\">the next Switch</a>.
