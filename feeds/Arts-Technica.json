The company also revealed Claude Code, a command line AI agent for developers currently available as a limited research preview.\nAnthropic calls Claude 3.7 the first \"hybrid reasoning model\" on the market, giving users the option to choose between quick responses or extended, visible chain-of-thought processing similar to OpenAI's o1 and o3 series models, Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, and DeepSeek's R1. When using Claude 3.7's API, developers can specify exactly how many tokens the model should use for thinking, up to its 128,000 token output limit.\nThe new model is available across all Claude subscription plans, and the extended thinking mode feature is available on all plans except the free tier. API pricing remains unchanged at $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with thinking tokens included in the output pricing since they are part of the context considered by the model.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Benj Edwards\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/#comments","content":"\n            Anthropic's first simulated reasoning model is a beast at coding tasks.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Anthropic's first simulated reasoning model is a beast at coding tasks.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/","categories":["AI","AI assistants","Anthropic","Anthropic Claude","chatbots","ChatGPT","chatgtp","Claude","Claude 3.7 Sonnet","large language models","machine learning"],"isoDate":"2025-02-24T22:23:34.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ryan Whitwam\n        ","title":"Nothing on Phone 3a Pro design: “Some people will hate it”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/nothing-explains-why-the-phone-3a-pro-ended-up-with-a-giant-camera/","pubDate":"Mon, 24 Feb 2025 20:34:00 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Nothing, the smartphone venture from OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, is on its third generation of Android smartphones.
