The setting comes as mercenary malware sold by NSO Group and a cottage industry of other exploit sellers continues to thrive. These players provide attacks-as-a-service through end-to-end platforms that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities on targeted devices, infect them with advanced spyware, and then capture contacts, message histories, locations, and other sensitive information.

There's almost no bezel around the display—in fact, there's almost no phone around the display. The body is only 5.8 mm thick, a substantial reduction from the similarly sized S25+ at 7.3 mm. That's really this phone's claim to fame: It's really thin. Everything else (and we do mean everything) is secondary to that.\nCramming premium camera modules into a smartphone is an engineering challenge even when you're not trying to make the phone as slim as possible. Similar to foldables, there just isn't enough space in the S25 Edge for a full suite of Samsung cameras. Therefore, this phone only has two rear camera modules: a 200 MP primary shooter that appears identical to the S25 Ultra's and a meager 12 MP ultrawide. There's a 12 MP selfie camera on the front as well. There is no telephoto lens at all, which you get even on the base model S25.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n                    Ryan Whitwam\n                ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/form-over-function-samsung-unveils-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge/#comments","content":"\n                        The S25 Edge is impressively thin, but at what cost?\n                    ","contentSnippet":"The S25 Edge is impressively thin, but at what cost?","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/form-over-function-samsung-unveils-the-super-slim-galaxy-s25-edge/","categories":["Tech","android","Samsung","smartphones"],"isoDate":"2025-05-13T15:14:43.000Z"},{"creator":"\n                    Benj Edwards\n                ","title":"GOP sneaks decade-long AI regulation ban into spending bill","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/gop-sneaks-decade-long-ai-regulation-ban-into-spending-bill/","pubDate":"Tue, 13 May 2025 14:58:26 +0000","content:encoded":"\n                            <p>On Sunday night, House Republicans added language to the Budget Reconciliation bill that would block all state and local governments from regulating AI for 10 years, <a href=\"https://404media.co/republicans-try-to-cram-ban-on-ai-regulation-into-budget-reconciliation-bill/\">404 Media</a> reports.
