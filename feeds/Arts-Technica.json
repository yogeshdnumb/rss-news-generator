Also will be into micromobility, not competing with Mini or Smart.\nAlso started out as an internal project to see if Rivian could use its knowledge of electric powertrains, vehicle electronics, and software to build other \"small vehicle form factors.\" In fact, in 2023, news broke of a Rivian e-bike in the works at Rivian, although it was unclear if it would be something with pedals or more like an electric motorcycle.\nThings are still rather vague. Also's announcement says its \"flagship product\" will launch in early 2026 and that the company will focus on the US and Europe at first. It will build \"an exciting range of electric vehicles that are efficient, sustainable, and delightful to use,\" using in-house technology.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jonathan M.
