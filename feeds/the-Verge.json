don’t need roads and regular folks like you and me can jump into a boat-sized electric pod and just fly anywhere on a whim. While we’ve been perfecting the miracle of human flight for more than a century, instant air transportation has long been relegated to science fiction.\nBut in the last decade, many companies have stepped up to help get flying cars and air taxis out of the Hollywood movie magic bubble. Startups like Joby Aviation and Archer are building electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that can taxi several people around in the sky without burning nasty fuel. The air taxi dream is already passing some regulatory milestones: the FAA has now established rules.\nAlthough these vehicles aren’t exactly the “flying cars” we’ve imagined, this is a rapidly growing new field with big established automakers like Toyota, Hyundai, Stellantis, and others either bankrolling their own ventures or one of the dozens of startups. And there’s a whole lot of drama and unpredictability in this new industry, from fighting over “stolen” patents to the companies that’ve failed to survive, like Lilium and the Larry Page-funded Kitty Hawk.

Heinlein’s 1959 book of the same name, not a remake of or sequel to 1997’s Paul Verhoeven-directed <em>Starship Trooper</em>s, say the outlet’s unnamed sources. In that movie, characters played by Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Neil Patrick Harris, and Michael Ironside are part of a comically jingoist militaristic society at war with space bugs. Blomkamp’s wife, Terri Tatchell, will reportedly co-produce<em> </em>the new <em>Troopers</em> movie. The outlet does not say when it’s expected to debut.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Heinlein’s book has been criticized for celebrating military fascism — criticism that extended to Verhoeven’s movie when it was released, as<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em> notes. These days, it’s generally accepted that his movie was meant as a send-up of the book. In a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24176026/light-phone-3-launch-price-release-date\">Kennedy Center interview</a>, Verhoeven said he’d hoped to show those who applaud the kind of over-the-top jingoism it presents that “what you have been admiring … might be evil.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Blomkamp has unsuccessfully tried to make movies in other sci-fi franchises, including a sequel to the Verhoeven-directed <em>RoboCop</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/11/17561574/robocop-reboot-mgm-district-9-director-neill-blomkamp\">called <em>RoboCop Returns</em></a>. He’d also planned a new <em>Alien</em> franchise film, but that was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/30/9642414/neill-blomkamp-alien-movie-on-hold\">put on hold</a> in favor of Ridley Scott’s <em>Prometheus</em> follow-up, <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/6/15570852/alien-covenant-review-ridley-scott\">Alien: Covenant</a></em>.

In that movie, characters played by Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Neil Patrick Harris, and Michael Ironside are part of a comically jingoist militaristic society at war with space bugs.

The outlet does not say when it’s expected to debut.\nHeinlein’s book has been criticized for celebrating military fascism — criticism that extended to Verhoeven’s movie when it was released, as The Hollywood Reporter notes. These days, it’s generally accepted that his movie was meant as a send-up of the book.

Hetfield leans in to within inches of his face as he and the fan scream, before the singer stands and moves on.

(There are so many smartphones!)

reality headsets for the better part of a decade. At WWDC 2023, it finally revealed the Vision Pro, which will launch as the first visionOS device on February 2nd.\nThe Vision Pro starts at $3,499 with 256GB of internal storage, while optional prescription lenses from Zeiss are available for $149.\n\n \n @verge \nThe Vision Pro is Apple’s highly anticipated “spatial computing” headset, and Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel tested all it’s capable of. The verdict? It’s the best video passthrough headset ever made, but not without some major tradeoffs. #apple #visionpro #headset #vr #tech #techtok\n ♬ original sound – The Verge \n  \n\n\nIn our review, we said the Vision Pro’s display is a technical marvel, with hand and eye tracking that’s a leap forward beyond what previously existed, however, those controls can be inconsistent, and in our experience, Apple’s Personas virtual avatars could be “uncanny and somewhat terrifying.”\nThe new headset uses two Apple Silicon chips (M2 Ultra and R1) and can be used for up to two hours with a tethered battery pack or for as long as you want if it’s plugged in. It also uses “natural control” with hand and eye tracking as well as voice commands. Users can switch between AR and VR using a digital crown-style dial, and depending on what they’re viewing, it displays their eyes on the front so that others know the person wearing it can see them.\nRead on for all our coverage so far on Apple’s Vision Pro headset.\nThe Vision Pro Metallica concert video is the best Apple Immersive video yet\n\t\t\t\nApple’s next Immersive concert experience for Vision Pro features Metallica.\n\t\t\t\nThe Vision Pro is getting easier to share with guests, and adding a new iPhone app\n\t\t\t\nBlackmagic’s Vision Pro immersive camera can be yours for only $29,995\n\t\t\t\nThe Vision Pro’s ultrawide Mac display is very close to being a killer app\n\t\t\t\nApple and Sony are working on Vision Pro support for PSVR 2 controllers\n\t\t\t\nBelkin’s Vision Pro strap should just come with the headset\n\t\t\t\nApple’s latest visionOS beta update wraps you in macOS.\n\t\t\t\nApple is preparing to sell a Belkin-made Vision Pro head strap.\n\t\t\t\nAnother tiny new reason to use your Vision Pro.\n\t\t\t\nApple’s reportedly slowing down Vision Pro production, for now\n\t\t\t\nWatch this one-minute preview of Apple’s first scripted Vision Pro short\n\t\t\t\nWith visionOS 2, Apple’s Vision Pro comes into focus\n\t\t\t\nDisney Plus now takes you to Iceland.\n\t\t\t\nLadies and gentlemen, The Weeknd (on Apple Vision Pro)\n\t\t\t\nApple’s Vision Pro: five months later\n\t\t\t\nThe Vision Pro will get Apple Intelligence and ‘Go Deeper’ in-store demos\n\t\t\t\nThe Vision Pro follow-up may get lower-res displays.\n\t\t\t\nApple’s rumored AR glasses are still a long way from reality.\n\t\t\t\nApple’s Vision Pro team is reportedly focused on building a cheaper headset\n\t\t\t\nThe visionOS 2 beta enables web-based VR.\n\t\t\t\nApple skipped over the best visionOS 2 updates\n\t\t\t\nApple is finally launching the Vision Pro outside the US\n\t\t\t\nMarvel’s What If…?
