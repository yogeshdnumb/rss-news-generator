And while Nintendo has taken steps to address the dreaded <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained\">Joy-Con drift</a> and earlier quality control problems, some issues persist.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#l7iZXy\">The best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode</a></li><li><a href=\"#xKHdxh\">The best Switch controller for handheld mode</a></li><li><a href=\"#ZdMFHG\">The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch</a></li><li><a href=\"#nwIiGD\">A Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck</a></li><li><a href=\"#DQLgpj\">A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock</a></li><li><a href=\"#3uEpzF\">An adapter that lets you use your own controllers</a></li><li><a href=\"#ayIYQW\">Other Switch controllers you should know about</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>In this buying guide, we focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed to match your play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re almost all the same and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (<a href=\"https://www.powera.com/c/nintendo/nintendo-switch/controllers/\">PowerA</a> and <a href=\"https://pdp.com/collections/nintendo-switch-controllers\">PDP</a> make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), there are certain things that it likely won’t be able to do unless otherwise noted:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It won’t have HD rumble. This is what Nintendo calls its advanced haptic feedback, which is more precise than that of many third-party controllers and more akin to Sony’s haptics engine in its subtlety. That said, some more limited rumble may be present.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Many third-party Switch controllers don’t have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, though more options are starting to implement the latter feature with varying degrees of quality.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most non-Nintendo options lack an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines, which unlock special features in some games.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Most third-party options won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.)&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>While some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22690100/how-to-pair-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-earbuds-nintendo-switch\">pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch</a> is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official <a href=\"https://howl.link/lij43lpwkhtzg\">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>. It’s the only traditional gamepad that checks all the boxes above — minus the 3.5mm audio jack — and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joysticks-Compatible-macOS-Black-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0D3X6THN8\">GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joysticks-Compatible-macOS-Black-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0CQLNSGH4\">Max</a>, meanwhile, make for great Xbox-style controllers with exhaustive customization, while the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/HORI-Nintendo-Switch-Split-Pad-Pro-Ergonomic-Controller-for-Handheld-Mode-Officially-Licensed-By-Nintendo-Black/539959895\">Hori Split Pad Pro</a> is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode.

It launched alongside the console in 2017 as a more traditional alternative to Nintendo’s quirky Joy-Cons, and in many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality.</p>\n\n<p>Aside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also the only controller we’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.</p>\n\n<p>The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.</p>\n\n<p>Given the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973\">if you have no more than two controllers</a> connected to your Switch at once.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xKHdxh\">The best Switch controller for handheld mode</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Joy-Con slots / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> No / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> via Joy-Con slots / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p>I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. That’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.</p>\n\n<p>The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One-half slides into each side of the Switch&nbsp;console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.</p>\n\n<p>The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — not to mention support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC&nbsp;— so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23007610/hori-split-pad-pro-attachment-nintendo-switch-price-features-review\">Split Pad Pro Attachment</a> that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t try to add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).</p>\n\n<p>The company also sells the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348870/hori-split-pad-compact-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-features\">Split Pad Compact</a>, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Compact-Light-Yellow/dp/B0BDSNHLDY\">typically costs around $40</a> (you can also get it <a href=\"https://howl.link/4thbwb6qz0qd2\">with an Attachment Set for $79.99</a>). It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ZdMFHG\">The best Xbox-style controller for the Switch</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>Yes / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> Yes</em></em></p>\n\n<p>On the surface, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0D41BBD7P\">GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0CFX7PKFV\">KingKong 3 Max</a> are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.</p>\n\n<p>But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JluAuIJ-tSY\">iFixit explains here</a>. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, both controllers now feature detachable rear-facing buttons. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they also won’t easily dislodge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter protruding variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer <em>a lot</em>. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of it more easily.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nwIiGD\">A Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL\">8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the 22-hour battery, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.</p>\n\n<p>The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options because it includes 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.</p>\n\n<p>As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"DQLgpj\">A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power: </strong>Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSPH1JYV/ref=twister_B0D1HQLSJ1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1\">8BitDo Pro 2</a> is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387041/overwatch-2-review-new-battle-pass-heroes-maps\"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.</p>\n\n<p>With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html\">8BitDo’s Ultimate software</a>&nbsp;on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;for $50 (or $54.99 if you want one of the incredibly cool&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shop.8bitdo.com/products/8bitdo-pro-2-bluetooth-controller-for-switch-pc-macos-android-steam-raspberry-pi-special-edition\">translucent blue, purple, or green</a>&nbsp;editions).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3uEpzF\">An adapter that lets you use your own controllers</h2>\n\n<p>There are many <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/7/18068220/gbros-wireless-adapter-gamecube-controller-nintendo-switch\">other</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/24/16533008/nintendo-switch-gamecube-controller-support-update\">devices</a> that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09M8CVMYF\">$19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2</a> lets you turn a Bluetooth&nbsp;controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)</p>\n\n<p>To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://support.8bitdo.com/Manual/USB-Adapter-2/xbox-switch.html\">8BitDo has an extensive support page</a> that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKG18DR\">and a USB hub</a>), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ayIYQW\">Other Switch controllers you should know about</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pJBZ31\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-Professional-Handheld-Nintendo/dp/B0CFLVJBBD/\">Nitro Deck</a> / <a href=\"https://amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8YGPT3G/\">Nitro Deck Plus</a></h3>\n\n<p>We like CRKD’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review\"><strong>Nitro Deck</strong></a> around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though, not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up <a href=\"https://crkd.gg/collections/allndp\"><strong>Nitro Deck Plus</strong></a> adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lK3UFj\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Wireless-Controller-Switch-Drifting-Nintendo/dp/B0CDX449NJ\">GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</a></h3>\n\n<p>We recently tested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Wireless-Controller-Switch-Drifting-Nintendo/dp/B0CDX449NJ\"><strong>GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</strong></a> ($45.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0D41BBD7P\">GuliKit KingKong 3 </a>— including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit can’t claim. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lru39S\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\">GameCube Style Wireless Controller</a></h3>\n\n<p>We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\"><strong>GameCube Style Wireless Controller</strong></a> ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Black/dp/B098TX8QB6\"><strong>PowerA Enhanced Wireless</strong></a><strong> </strong>($59.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, February 7th:</strong> Updated pricing and availability.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"The best Nintendo Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with it.

That said, some more limited rumble may be present. \nMany third-party Switch controllers don’t have motion controls for gestures or gyroscopic aiming in games that support it, though more options are starting to implement the latter feature with varying degrees of quality.\nMost non-Nintendo options lack an NFC reader for Amiibo cards or figurines, which unlock special features in some games. \nMost third-party options won’t be able to turn on the Switch remotely. (You’ll have to manually press the console’s power button.) \nWhile some Switch controllers have 3.5mm headphone jacks, getting audio out of them can only happen through a wired USB connection, not wirelessly. For most people, pairing Bluetooth headphones to your Switch is a sufficient (and very easy) workaround.\nIf you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. It’s the only traditional gamepad that checks all the boxes above — minus the 3.5mm audio jack — and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and Max, meanwhile, make for great Xbox-style controllers with exhaustive customization, while the Hori Split Pad Pro is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s 8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller and DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller, both of which are well worth a look.\n\n\nConnectivity\nDoes it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality\nDo the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra features\nAre there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macros? Can you use it on multiple platforms?\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomization\nCan you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nIs it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?\n\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nNearly eight years down the road, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller is still the best gamepad for the Switch. It launched alongside the console in 2017 as a more traditional alternative to Nintendo’s quirky Joy-Cons, and in many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality.\nAside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s also the only controller we’ve tested (again, aside from the Joy-Cons) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.\nThe buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.\nGiven the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only if you have no more than two controllers connected to your Switch at once.)\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nSupported Platforms: Switch / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No\nI’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. That’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.\nThe Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One-half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.\nThe Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — not to mention support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Pro Attachment that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t try to add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).\nThe company also sells the Split Pad Compact, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that typically costs around $40 (you can also get it with an Attachment Set for $79.99). It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nOn the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.\nBut there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).\nAdditionally, both controllers now feature detachable rear-facing buttons. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they also won’t easily dislodge. \nThe longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter protruding variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.\nIn summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of it more easily.\nA Switch controller for PC and Steam Deck\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\n8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the 22-hour battery, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.\nThe Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options because it includes 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.\nAs for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\nThe 8BitDo Pro 2 is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.\nWith 8BitDo’s Ultimate software on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. On its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for $50 (or $54.99 if you want one of the incredibly cool translucent blue, purple, or green editions).\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nThere are many other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)\nTo our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app. \n8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.\nIf you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.\nOther Switch controllers you should know about\nNitro Deck / Nitro Deck Plus\nWe like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though, not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).\nGameSir T4 Cyclone Pro\nWe recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($45.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit can’t claim. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.\nGameCube Style Wireless Controller\nWe also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($59.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($59.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.\nUpdate, February 7th: Updated pricing and availability.","summary":"The best Nintendo Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with it.

It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything, and it now <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged\">starts with 16GB of RAM</a> and comes in a 15-inch version for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22734645/apple-macbook-pro-2021-ports-magsafe-touch-bar-usb-c-future\">Despite losing its way around the mid-2010s</a>, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M3 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, 1080p webcam, and MagSafe charging, check. The Air M3 wasn’t made for heavy gaming, video editing, or for those who want more than two USB-C ports, but for nearly everyone else, it’s a great option.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you do need some of that, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\">14-inch MacBook Pro M4</a> is a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599. But opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port and an SD card slot.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25356164/DSCF0215.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A photo of Apple’s M3-powered MacBook Air laptop.\" title=\"A photo of Apple’s M3-powered MacBook Air laptop.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air M3 is the best laptop of 2024.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\" />\n<p>It’s absolutely worth spending an extra $100 to get the Air M3 over the MacBook Air M2, which Apple still sells. It’s about 16 to 18 percent faster than Apple’s M2 chip, and the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4U9nCMV7cv4\">storage on the 256GB configurations is up to twice as fast</a>. The new Airs also support two external displays with the lid closed, which is another improvement from the previous generation. If you opt for the larger model, you’ll find that the speakers on 15-inch Air M3 are vastly superior, especially on the low end. You can actually hear the bass, whereas on the 13-inch, it’s nearly nonexistent. And if you get the midnight color in either model, keep a microfiber cloth handy. The amount of fingerprints it collects turns the chassis into a CSI playground.</p>\n\n<p>We previously recommended upgrading the MacBook Air M3 to at least 16GB of memory, but Apple now does that for you, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged\">all current Air models now start at 16GB of RAM</a>. You can still find 8GB configurations at some retailers, but it’s not worthwhile unless you get it on some kind of fire sale. The increased RAM will improve the laptop’s ability to multitask now and will give you some extra years of service down the line.

Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air with this laptop, and it mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. They’re the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night.</p>\n\n<p>The greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is if Windows on Arm has all the app compatibility you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there remain outliers. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips.

It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s miles ahead of what any Copilot Plus PC can do, too, including the Intel Core Ultra laptops we’ve recently tested. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.</p>\n\n<p>There are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,700 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)</p>\n\n<p>At just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff.

It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot.

The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD.

The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors.

You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. That’s how I usually use it at home: propped up and plugged into an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement. But when I’m away, I use the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.</p>\n\n<p>The Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away.

But you can’t buy them all. So we’ve done the very difficult (very difficult, trust us) task of selecting some of the best laptops you can get. Whether you’re looking for a Chromebook, a gaming laptop, a 2-in-1 convertible, an ultralight notebook, or something that’s a little bit of each, we’ve got options for you.\nOur current pick for the best laptop is the MacBook Air M3. It’s a device that does just about everything right. It has no major flaws — and it even got better recently thanks to a free RAM upgrade from Apple. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming.\nIt’s getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops from the merely good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. A great laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad; Its display should be bright and sharp; its processor should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. And the whole package should be easy to carry around and able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.\n\n\nValue\nPrice is a very important factor in evaluating devices for this page. We’re seeking laptops that offer great value for their asking price and that are the best of the best compared to other laptops in their price category. The more expensive a device, the more exceptional it has to be to make it on here.\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance\nWe want laptops with enough power to accommodate their target audience. An ultraportable laptop should be able to handle a standard office workload without excessive heat or fan noise. A gaming laptop should run today’s popular games.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeyboard and trackpad\nThese are the two biggest reasons you’d get a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. They’d better be good or you’ll hate every minute.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen\nWe like displays that are color-accurate, bright, and sharp enough that you aren’t distracted by jagged edges or visible pixels.\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nWe’re looking for laptops with a solid, durable build that can handle a standard amount of briefcase wear-and-tear while (in most categories) easy to carry around from place to place.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life\nBattery life is much more important in some categories than it is in others. That said, in general, we assume that most shoppers are choosing a laptop over a desktop because they value some ability to work away from a plug. Battery life gives a user more freedom and makes a device more reliable for travel, so we consider it here.\n\n\n\n\n\nPort selection\nThe more ports, the better.\n\n\nOur other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s include the MacBook Pro 16 and the 13.8-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition with a Snapdragon X Elite chip. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.\nThe best laptop\nCPU: M3 (8-core) / GPU: M3 (8- or 10-core) / RAM: 16GB, 24GB / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.6-inch or 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display, 2560 x 1664 or 2880 x 1864 , 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches or 0.45 x 13.40 x 9.35 inches / Weight: 2.7 pounds (13-inch) or 3.3 pounds (15-inch)\nApple’s MacBook Air M3 is the best laptop for most people — Mac users, of course, but also the platform-agnostic or anyone who wants a no-fuss, straightforward machine that doesn’t bombard them with advertisements or bloatware. It’s a productivity laptop that can do a bit of everything, and it now starts with 16GB of RAM and comes in a 15-inch version for those who like their laptops a little larger. It’s hard to find another laptop that offers this kind of combination of performance and battery life in a thin and light chassis.\nDespite losing its way around the mid-2010s, Apple has a long history of sending quality MacBooks to market, and the Air M3 is no different. A smooth, almost ethereal trackpad, check. A chiclet-style keyboard that makes typing feel like a dance, check. Fast Wi-Fi adapter, color-rich display, 1080p webcam, and MagSafe charging, check. The Air M3 wasn’t made for heavy gaming, video editing, or for those who want more than two USB-C ports, but for nearly everyone else, it’s a great option.\nHowever, if you do need some of that, the 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 is a great bang-for-your-buck laptop in its own right at $1,599. But opting for a Pro over an Air is best for students in creative fields and content creators needing more headroom and features like a third USB-C port and an SD card slot.\nIt’s absolutely worth spending an extra $100 to get the Air M3 over the MacBook Air M2, which Apple still sells. It’s about 16 to 18 percent faster than Apple’s M2 chip, and the storage on the 256GB configurations is up to twice as fast. The new Airs also support two external displays with the lid closed, which is another improvement from the previous generation. If you opt for the larger model, you’ll find that the speakers on 15-inch Air M3 are vastly superior, especially on the low end. You can actually hear the bass, whereas on the 13-inch, it’s nearly nonexistent. And if you get the midnight color in either model, keep a microfiber cloth handy. The amount of fingerprints it collects turns the chassis into a CSI playground.\nWe previously recommended upgrading the MacBook Air M3 to at least 16GB of memory, but Apple now does that for you, as all current Air models now start at 16GB of RAM. You can still find 8GB configurations at some retailers, but it’s not worthwhile unless you get it on some kind of fire sale. The increased RAM will improve the laptop’s ability to multitask now and will give you some extra years of service down the line. (Important since you’d have to buy a whole new laptop to upgrade the memory.) 256GB of storage is easier to get away with, given the plethora of cloud and external storage options available.\nIf you don’t need to buy right away, you might consider waiting for the M4 version of the MacBook Air, which is expected in early 2025. But the M3 Air is a great option if you can’t wait.\nRead our review of the Apple MacBook Air M3.\nBest Chromebook\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 5 115U / GPU: Intel UHD / RAM: 8GB, 16GB LPDDR5 / Storage: 256GB, 512GB / Display: Touch 14-inch FHD 1920 x 1200, 60Hz IPS with stylus support, 340 nits / Dimensions: 12.35 x 8.84 x 0.71 inches / Weight: 3.21 pounds \nLike last year, Acer’s newest Chromebook Spin is the best Chromebook we’ve seen so far in 2024 — and it’s still part of the Plus line of Chromebooks, which now have Google Gemini features integrated with ChromeOS. It also comes with a 12-month subscription to the Google One AI premium plan, which includes 2TB of cloud storage space.\nThe Core Ultra 5 115U is slower than last gen’s Intel Core i5-1335U (the Ultra has eight cores with clock speeds up to 4.20GHz, while the Core i5 has 10 cores and goes up to 4.60GHz), but the Ultra Core has an NPU, which means it’s better suited for running AI-related tasks on-device. The new Spin Chromebook also supports the current LPDDR5 memory standard, which is faster than the previous generation in the 2023 Spin 714.\nAcer upgraded some of the connectivity port options, too. The Spin 714 now has two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, instead of two USB-C 3.2 ports, for much faster data transfer and power delivery.\nBest Snapdragon X laptop\nCPU: Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus X1P-64-100, Snapdragon X Elite X1E-80-100 / GPU: Qualcomm Adreno / RAM: 16GB, 32GB, 64GB LPDDR5X (soldered) / Storage: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB / Display: 13.8-inch touchscreen LCD, 2304 x 1536 120Hz, 600 nits / Dimensions: 11.85 x 8.67 x 0.69 inches / Weight: 2.96 pounds\nOut of all the Snapdragon Copilot Plus PCs we’ve tested so far, the 13- and 15-inch Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th edition stood out for its balance of performance, exceptional battery life and standby time, and quality components (120Hz screen, keyboard, webcam, trackpad, etc.). Microsoft was obviously gunning for Apple’s MacBook Air with this laptop, and it mostly delivers that level of hardware experience for a Windows machine. They’re the full package if you want a thin-and-light productivity machine running Windows that easily lasts all day and into the night.\nThe greater concern with Snapdragon X-equipped laptops is if Windows on Arm has all the app compatibility you need to get your work done. Most everyday apps work fine, via native Arm versions or emulation, but there remain outliers. Also, if you like the idea of your productivity machine being able to pull light gaming duties (one of Windows’ advantages over Mac) then you’re likely better off with a laptop using Intel’s Lunar Lake or AMD’s Ryzen AI chips. Snapdragon X laptops can only run a fraction of the games you find on Steam.\nMicrosoft recently announced Intel Lunar Lake- based versions of the Surface Laptop 7, due out in mid-February, but they’re priced a ridiculous $500 higher and aimed solely at businesses. It’s a shame, because having this hardware with Lunar Lake’s compatibility might have been an appealing prospect.\nRead our review of the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition.\nThe best 16-inch Windows laptop\nCPU: AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 / GPU: Radeon 890M, Radeon 880M  / RAM: 32GB, 24GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: touch 16-inch 2880 x 1800, 120Hz OLED with stylus support, 500 nits peak HDR / Dimensions: 13.92 x 9.57 x 0.47 ~ 0.51 inches / Weight: 3.21 pounds \nThe 16-inch Asus Zenbook S 16 is the best-looking, best-performing Windows laptop we tested over the summer; it’s also so thin and lightweight you wouldn’t know it just by holding it! It can handle a little bit of everything, from emails to graphic design work, and it tackles gaming surprisingly well for a laptop without a separate graphics card. It’s miles ahead of what any Copilot Plus PC can do, too, including the Intel Core Ultra laptops we’ve recently tested. It’s a lovely, catch-all device.\nThere are only two Zenbook S 16 models as of now. The $1,700 one comes in gray with AMD’s flagship Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 chip and 32GB of memory, and the $1,400 model comes in white with the lower-tier AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 and 24GB of memory. Otherwise, they are identical. Both feature OLED touch displays with a native 2880 x 1800 (3K) resolution and 120Hz refresh rate, stylus support, 1TB of storage, and the same ports / Wi-Fi adapter. Everything but the Windows version. (The more expensive model gets Home; the cheaper one gets Pro.)\nAt just 11 hours, its battery life doesn’t last as long as similar laptops we’ve tested, such as the Samsung Galaxy Book4 Edge and Dell XPS 14, but it’s a small tradeoff. There’s currently no other Windows laptop that offers as much performance and versatility in a 16-inch chassis for the price.\nRead our review of the Asus Zenbook S 16.\nThe best laptop for high-end gaming\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 7945HX3D / GPU: Nvidia Geforce RTX 4090 / RAM: 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 17-inch IPS QHD, 240Hz display, 3ms, 300 nits, 100 percent DCI-P3 / Dimensions: 15.55 x 11.1 x 1.11 inches / Weight: 6.51 pounds\nThe ROG Strix Scar 17 X3D is big. It’s loud, it’s garish, and it’s flat-out the fastest gaming laptop we’ve tested. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen 9 79045HX3D processor, it leaves models with the same top-tier RTX 4090 graphics card and Intel’s fastest CPUs in the dust. It can run many of today’s AAA titles at 1440p with triple-digit frame rates.\nThe Scar 17 X3D has a 17-inch 2560 x 1440 240Hz screen with G-Sync, oodles of ports, a pleasant keyboard, and RGB galore. At over six and a half pounds and 17 inches on the diagonal, it’s your classic high-performance, barely portable gaming laptop.\nIts webcam is potato, battery life is exactly as bad as you’d expect from everything we just listed, and it’s expensive, but for now this is the high-water mark for gaming laptops.\nFor more down-to-earth performance and price, you can also get the ROG Strix Scar 17 with an RTX 4070 for about $2,200 or with an RTX 4080 for about $2,900.\nRead our Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 X3D review.\nThe best MacBook for photo and video editing\nCPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / GPU: M4 Pro, M4 Max / RAM: 24GB or 48GB (M4 Pro),  36GB – 128 GB (M4 Max) / Storage: 512GB, 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 8TB / Display: 14.2 / 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR, 3024 x 1964 / 3456 x 2234, adaptive refresh up to 120Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 (14-inch) / 14.01 x 9.77 x 0.66 inches (16-inch) / Weight: 3.5 / 4.7 pounds (M4 Pro), 3.6 / 4.8 pounds (M4 Max) \nIf you need more power for intensive creative work — like 3D rendering and working with ultra-high-resolution photos and video — the MacBook Pro is your best bet. Both the 14- and 16-inch models are available with powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max processors. There’s also a 14-inch Pro with a standard M4 processor, and while it’s a formidable step up from the MacBook Air as an everyman’s “pro” laptop, the M4 Pro and Max processors still outclass it in performance.\nProcessors aside, the MacBook Pro has remained largely unchanged since 2021. It has a bright, beautiful, color-accurate, high-res screen with HDR and an adaptive refresh rate of up to 120Hz; amazing speakers, a comfortable keyboard and trackpad; and a good port loadout: three Thunderbolt 5 / USB-C ports, plus HDMI 2.1 and an SD card slot. The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a few hundred dollars cheaper than the 16-inch, but aside from the very lowest processor options, most configurations are available in either size, so pick whichever works for you.\nIn our benchmarks, which test a variety of creative tasks including encoding, playback, and export time, the MacBook Pro 16 did better than any laptop we’ve ever used — the only other machines that have come close to matching this thing in some of our benchmarks are high-end desktop PCs. The battery life is also record-shattering. The top-of-the-line 16-inch M4 Max model easily lasted all day in our most recent testing, with no battery-saving features enabled and even keeping the screen on full-time.\nMost people who need much more power than a MacBook Air — including all but the most demanding pro photographers — will be fine with an M4 Pro model, which starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and a 512GB SSD. The 16-inch starts at $2,499 for a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB of memory, and 512GB SSD. The M4 Pro chip can be configured with up to 48GB of memory and a 4TB SSD, at the usual absurd Apple markups, and it supports up to two external 6K displays.\nIf you absolutely need more GPU power — or more than two external monitors — you can step up to the M4 Max. The base M4 Max with 14 CPU cores and 32 GPU cores, plus 36GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, starts at $3,199 in the 14-inch and $3,499 in the 16-inch. There’s also an M4 Max with 16 CPU and 40 GPU cores, which starts at $3,699 and $3,999, respectively. The M4 Max models are configurable with up to 128GB of RAM and 8TB of storage and can support up to four external monitors. The vast majority of people don’t have workloads heavy enough to notice a significant difference between the M4 Pro and M4 Max; if you do, you probably know it.\nRead our reviews of the MacBook Pro 16 M4 Pro / Max and MacBook Pro 14 M4.\nThe best 14-inch gaming laptop\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 9 8945 HS / GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 4070 / RAM: 16GB, 32GB / Storage: 1TB / Display: 14-inch OLED, 2880 x 1800, 60Hz and 120Hz, 400 nits / Dimensions: 12.24 x 8.66 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 3.31 pounds\nThe Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 with an RTX 4070 is the most well-balanced 14-inch gaming laptop. It’s powerful enough to reach 60 frames per second on ultra graphics at its native resolution (with or without DLSS) and thin and lightweight enough without trapping too much heat in its chassis. Also, its battery can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge, which is good for a gaming laptop.\nIts display has been upgraded from an IPS to an OLED, it has 1TB of SSD storage and 32GB of memory, and Asus put lighting back on the lid — not a dot matrix, but a strip of LEDs spanning diagonally across.\nAll that for $2,000 to $2,200 makes it hard to justify getting anything else, though you can save up to $500 if you get the RTX 4060 model. Though it has only half the RAM, it has the same great screen and build, and its frame rates are only about ten percent lower than the 4070 Zephyrus at 1080p/ultra.\nIf you spend up to $700 more on the Razer Blade 14, you’ll get higher frame rates, a 240Hz screen, and upgradeable RAM — but its battery life barely hits four hours in general use, and its display doesn’t support G-Sync or HDR.\nThe best dual-screen laptop\nCPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 155U / GPU: Intel UHD (integrated) / RAM: 16GB LPDDR5X / Storage: 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD / Display: 13.3-inch (2880 x 1800) 60Hz OLED touchscreen w/ stylus support / Dimensions: 11.78 x 8.03 x 0.63 inches / Weight: 2.95 pounds\nA dual-screen laptop is exactly what it sounds like: a laptop with a second screen where the keyboard normally goes.\nThe Lenovo Yoga Book 9i has a 360-degree hinge, which lets you use it as a regular laptop, a (large) tablet, and more. You can put it in clamshell mode and write or sketch on the bottom screen with a stylus or fold the keyboard folio into a stand to prop it up and take advantage of both screens. That’s how I usually use it at home: propped up and plugged into an external monitor as a three-screen desktop replacement. But when I’m away, I use the included Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Its touchscreen gestures are super responsive but too responsive for the virtual keyboard and trackpad. It’s easy to mistype and accidentally minimize windows.\nThe Yoga Book’s only real competitor is Asus’ Zenbook Duo. The Duo’s physical keyboard includes a trackpad and makes it look a lot more like a traditional laptop. Its 14-inch OLED screens are a little bigger and brighter, it has a ton of port options, it’s more powerful, and it’s a little easier to fold up and put away. But it’s also heavier (at 3.64 pounds), its top lid doesn’t fold back far enough to use it as a tablet, and its touchscreen gestures aren’t as responsive.\nRead our head-to-head review of the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i and the Asus Zenbook Duo.\nThe best repairable laptop\nCPU: Intel Core i5-1340P / i7-1360P / 17-1370P, AMD Ryzen 7 7840U / GPU: Intel UHD / Iris Xe, Radeon 700M / RAM: 8GB, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB / Storage: 250GB, 500GB, 1TB, 2TB / Display: 13.5 inch IPS, 2256 x 1540, 60Hz, no touch option / Dimensions: 11.68 x 9.01 x 0.62 inches / Weight: 2.87 pounds\nIf you want a 13-inch laptop that you can configure and assemble yourself, from the ground up, the Framework Laptop 13 is pretty much your only option. The Framework is a modular laptop that users can repair and upgrade over the length of their ownership. Everything from the RAM, to the storage, to even the processor can be upgraded down the line. The company has even come out with upgrades for parts like speakers and hinges that you can install yourself. Not only can you buy it as a prebuilt system, but you can also order it as a DIY kit, allowing you to assemble the entire thing yourself and swap out parts as you please. \nRepairability aside, the Framework has a number of laudable features as a laptop itself. The display is bright and high resolution, the speakers are great, and the chassis is quite portable, coming in at under three pounds. The 3:2 aspect ratio provides a lot of room to work and is still a somewhat rare find on today’s market.\nThat said, I won’t pretend that this is the best 13-inch laptop you can buy. On its own merits, it is an unremarkable system with a somewhat generic look and plasticky build, particularly compared to others in its price category. Nevertheless, the Framework’s standout feature is the unprecedented access it allows its users to replace and repair its parts. We’d love to see more companies make that kind of commitment to sustainable design.\nRead our Framework Laptop 13 review.\nThe best laptop under $400\nCPU: Intel Core i3-1215U / GPU: Intel UHD / RAM: 8GB / Storage: 128GB, 256GB UFS / Display: 14-inch IPS, 1920 x 1080, 60Hz, non-touch / Dimensions: 12.9 x 8.4 x 0.74 inches / Weight: 3.17 pounds\nThe Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 is the least expensive laptop with Google’s new Plus certification. At around $400 for a Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it’s the baseline Chromebook you should consider if you can’t spend any more.\nIt’s so easy to get a bad Chromebook at this price, so it’s a relief that the Chromebook Plus CX34 is so good. Not only does it have respectable internals, but the 1080p screen and 1080p webcam are good for the price, the keyboard is great, and the trackpad is fine, if a bit stiff. Battery life is decent, too, and like all Plus Chromebooks, it comes with 10 years of software updates. You can spend more on a laptop, and you probably should, but don’t buy a Chromebook less powerful than this one.\nRead our review of the Asus Chromebook Plus CX34.\nUpdate, February 4th: Updated pricing and replaced the Dell XPS 13 with the Microsoft Surface Laptop 7th Edition as the pick for Best Snapdragon X laptop.","summary":"We test a wide variety of laptops each year here at The Verge, and many of them are very good.

That’s okay, because the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl have historically been one of the better times of the year to snag a discounted set. In fact, Amazon, Best Buy, Woot, and a number of retailers are already discounting a variety of TV sets ahead of the big game on February 9th. Many of the current promos aren’t Super Bowl-specific, mind you, but there are still some great options if you’re on the hunt for a budget-friendly QLED TV for your viewing party or a gamer-friendly OLED that can serve your entertainment needs year-round.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ll keep an eye out for more 4K TV deals as we get closer to the big day and update this post accordingly, so be sure to keep checking back in the run-up to Super Bowl LIX.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">LG C4 OLED TV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re looking for an OLED TV, LG’s exceptional C4 is currently down to one of its best prices to date.&nbsp;Right now, for instance, you can buy the 65-inch model for about $1,496.99 ($1,203 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CVS18PH9/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/4ywm14n0q0i9k\">Best Buy</a>. The 77-inch model is also available for around $2,196.99 ($1,503 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CVRDNLVX/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/noker5d1sqd26\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/2ucem87ka5duv\">LG</a>, the latter of which is offering <a href=\"https://www.lg.com/us/promotions/soundbar-bundle-savings\">up to $200 off select LG soundbars</a> with your purchase through March 2nd.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The C4 offers a bright, vibrant display with the kind of inky blacks that characterize OLED panels, along with support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. The last-gen TV remains an excellent option for gaming, too, with four HDMI 2.1 ports, a 144Hz refresh rate, and support for AMD FreeSync Premium as well as Nvidia G-Sync. It even comes with a Wii-like Magic Remote, which, in many instances, we’ve found to be easier to navigate with than the remote’s arrow keys.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">LG C3 OLED TV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The last-gen <strong>LG C3 OLED</strong> is also still a fantastic television if you can’t quite stretch for the LG C4. <a href=\"https://howl.link/2hep2bve9jzsm\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/LG-77-Class-4K-UHD-OLED-Web-OS-Smart-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-C3-Series/2024633768\">Walmart’s</a> current sale price of around $1,669 (about $600 off) on the 77-inch model isn’t quite as good as the $1,500 price tag we saw during a recent flash sale, but it’s still an incredible value for a massive OLED TV that offers a similar experience to the LG C4.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although LG’s newer flagship can achieve around 1,000 nits of peak brightness before enhancements, the C3 isn’t exactly dim, with a peak HDR brightness of just over 800 nits. LG’s Brightness Booster feature helps push it quite a bit further, too, with an estimated 40 percent improvement. The last-gen TV is capped at a 120Hz variable refresh rate but otherwise boasts many of the same features as the C4, including support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It also runs on LG’s webOS, works with the wand-like Magic Remote, and features a game mode that improves input latency and prevents burn-in.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">LG B4 OLED TV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re looking for a more affordable OLED,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24023584/lg-2024-oled-tv-lineup-m4-g4-c4-b4-features-specs\"><strong>LG’s entry-level B4 TV</strong></a> is on sale at <a href=\"https://howl.link/ml56mlpfoana9\">Best Buy</a> in the 48-inch size starting at just $599.99 ($200 off), matching its all-time low. It’s discounted in larger configurations, too, with the 55-inch going for $999.99 ($400 off) at <a href=\"https://howl.link/r9h0yb1ttuie3\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/eve31d1owwqvr\">LG’s online storefront</a> and the 65-inch selling for around $1,296.99 ($200 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/LG-55-Inch-Processor-AI-Powered-OLED55B4PUA/dp/B0CVS18Z6R\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/3oq4nv9t9l6xr\">Best Buy</a>, and direct from <a href=\"https://howl.link/tt1tsiop7lgdv\">LG</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TV isn’t as bright or powerful as the aforementioned C4 series — it’s outfitted with an older A8 processor, as opposed to LG’s newer A9 chip — but it’s still relatively snappy and slated to receive several more years of webOS updates, ensuring the navigation and user experience should be dialed in for the foreseeable future. It also features a buttery 120Hz refresh rate, four full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 ports, and support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. And like the LG C4, it includes support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Sony Bravia A95L</strong> QD-OLED</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sony’s Bravia A95L is also receiving a steep discount ahead of the Super Bowl.&nbsp;Right now, you can buy the 65-inch model for around $2,998 at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-QD-OLED-inch-BRAVIA-Ultra/dp/B0BYPYRH4F\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/7agsl8sj5ekuf\">Best Buy</a>, which matches its Black Friday price. Other sizes are on sale, too, including the 55-inch, which is going for around $2,498 ($300 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sony-QD-OLED-inch-BRAVIA-Ultra/dp/B0BYPT328K\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/a6i1utdazyj2v\">Best Buy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Sony A95L <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221338/best-tv-2024-sony-a95l-value-electronics-shootout\">was arguably the best TV we saw</a> last year, largely due to its vibrant, lifelike picture quality. The bright 4K QD-OLED TV includes support for Dolby Vision and HDR10 as well, along with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, a pair of HDMI 2.1 inputs, and support for Google’s excellent TV platform.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Samsung OLED S95D TV</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/7/24028974/samsung-s95d-qd-oled-tv-announced-glare-free-screen\"><strong>Samsung OLED S95D</strong></a> is another terrific OLED set that’s also down to one of its best prices to date in multiple configurations. Right now, for example, you can purchase the 55-inch model for around $1,899.99 ($700) at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CV9RWC4B/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/kz87gy484xi2t\">Best Buy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/nbhi5q3qx8l60\">Samsung’s online storefront</a>. The 65-inch panel, meanwhile, is available from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CV9BPF93/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/v4a2csotxm7i6\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/62tzrftht6gwc\">Samsung</a> for around $2,299.99 ($1,100 off). If you purchase directly from Samsung, you’ll also be eligible for a discount on select Samsung soundbars, with the exact discount dependent on which model you choose.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S95D comes with a glare-free display that does an excellent job of minimizing unwanted reflections, allowing it to provide rich colors and contrast at high brightness levels. It lacks support for Dolby Vision, but it does offer a 144Hz variable refresh rate, four HDMI 2.1 ports, and support for Alexa and Google Assistant. It also comes with Samsung’s One Connect Box, which lets you connect your gaming console, set-top boxes, and other devices to your TV with a single cable, as opposed to a mess of wires. And, of course, Samsung’s Tizen OS lets you stream from a wide selection of apps, including Netflix, Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, and Max.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Samsung Frame TV (2024)</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Samsung’s Frame TV doesn’t offer the pristine image quality found in OLED displays, but it’s unique in that the TV showcases artwork when idle. Combined with its anti-glare matte display, it makes for a stylish 4K TV that looks more akin to a canvas painting than a black void. It’s a shame it doesn’t offer Dolby Vision or VRR support, but it still has a range of solid specs, including a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, HDMI 2.1 support, and compatibility with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. Just bear in mind, <a href=\"https://howl.link/pe8zc5yde68ra\">you’ll need to pay for a subscription</a> ($4.99 a month / $49.90 annually) to get unlimited access to all of the artwork available in the Samsung Art Store.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now through 1AM ET on February 9th, <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-qled-4k-ls03d-the-frame-series-2024z-11\">Woot</a> is offering the best prices we’ve seen on Samsung’s last-gen Frame TV. Right now, for instance, the 55- and 65-inch models are on sale for $867.99 ($630 off) and 1,247.99 ($752 off), respectively, which are all-time lows. Samsung, meanwhile, is discounting the TV through February 9th while offering an additional $50 off its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/7/24029243/samsung-music-frame-speaker-announced-specs-features\">Music Frame speaker</a> or an HW-S700D Dolby Soundbar. The 55-inch model is on sale at <a href=\"https://howl.link/fdo38d4jhzuk4\">Samsung’s online storefront</a> for $899.99 ($600 off) or at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Anti-Reflection-Customizable-QN55LS03D/dp/B0CV9F2Q5V/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/yjkvzjglp7auc\">Best Buy</a> without the aforementioned perks for the same price.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">TCL QM85 TV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re looking for something cheaper, TCL makes some excellent budget-friendly 4K TVs, one of which is the <strong>TCL QM85</strong>. The 2024 flagship is steeply discounted right now, with the 65-inch model going for around $897.99 (about $600 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TCL-85QM851G-Accelerator-Streaming-Television/dp/B0CZM7LZCM\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/bb59m1htey4nx\">Best Buy</a>. Larger configurations are on sale, too, with the 75-inch panel going for $1,299.99 ($700 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/TCL-85QM851G-Accelerator-Streaming-Television/dp/B0CZM95SG6\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/mw8kuvoxmlc8f\">Best Buy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The TV’s bright QD-Mini LED panel offers sharp, vibrant image quality with a speedy 144Hz variable refresh rate. Along with support for Dolby Atmos and DTS Virtual:X, it comes with an integrated subwoofer for a fuller, more immersive audio experience. Other notable features include support for the Google TV interface, along with compatibility with Alexa, Apple Home, and Google Home.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Hisense U8N QLED TV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hisense is another brand that sells terrific, budget-friendly TVs. And right now, you can buy the 65-inch U8N — the company’s 2024 flagship QLED TV — for just $899.99 ($600 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY4SM6P8\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/gsmjvxz43xk89\">Best Buy</a>, which is about $2 shy of its best price to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The U8N offers a lot of features you’d typically find in pricier TVs. That includes a 144Hz variable refresh rate and two high-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 ports (one of which supports eARC), along with support for both Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. There’s no OLED display, but you do get a Mini LED backlight with support for up to 3,000 nits of brightness. You also get full-array local dimming, which allows it to deliver punchy colors alongside rich contrast and deep black levels. The TV additionally supports Google’s excellent TV software as well as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa for hands-free voice control.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Hisense U7N LCD TV</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re looking for a budget-friendly alternative to the U8N, you can buy <strong>Hisense’s 55-inch U7N</strong> on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-65-Inch-Mini-LED-Google-65U7N/dp/B0CY56XCJ9/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/ufs42pbu38z85\">Best Buy</a> for $498 ($200 off), which is one of its better prices to date. A few other sizes are also on discount right now, including the massive 75-inch panel, which you can purchase for around $899.96 ($600 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-65-Inch-Mini-LED-Google-65U7N/dp/B0CY4QVYCS/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/6y76qut5d7qmf\">Best Buy</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 4K LCD TV shares a lot in common with the U8N, including support for a 144Hz variable refresh rate and a pair of HDMI 2.1 ports. The U7N also runs on Google’s TV interface, offers support for all the major HDR formats, and works with all the same voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant, etc.). The main difference between the two TVs is that the Mini LED panel on the U7N doesn’t offer the same contrast or brightness levels as the U8N, which maxes out at 3,000 nits as opposed to 1,500. That being said, it’s still a good display with full-array local dimming and nearly all the same features.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Super Bowl TV deals worth a look</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>If you’re working with a tighter budget, the <strong>TCL Q6 QLED</strong> is on sale in multiple sizes as well. You can, for instance, grab the 65-inch model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZMG5X67\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/80lyl8ylmfnbi\">Best Buy</a> for $369.99 ($180 off), which is $2 shy of its lowest price to date. The 4K TV lacks more advanced bells and whistles, but it still supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and Google’s terrific interface. It has a 60Hz refresh rate, though, it does allow for 120Hz upscaling via TCL’s “Game Accelerator 120” feature. That being said, if you want buttery smooth frame rates, you could also pick up <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZM862VY\">the 85-inch panel for $798</a>, which does sport a native 120Hz refresh.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Samsung’s OLED TVs can be expensive, but you can save a bit by opting for an older model. Take the <strong>S90D OLED</strong>, for example, which is on sale in several sizes, including a 65-inch configuration that’s available from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Tracking-Xcelerator-Enhancer-Upscaling/dp/B0CV9VGMPT\">Amazon</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/jkx0loeff85ia\">Best Buy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/ev6gorecyfo4i\">Samsung</a> starting around $1,496.99 ($200 off). That’s just $100 more than the lowest price we’ve seen on the 4K TV. The 2024 model is only a slight downgrade from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/7/24028974/samsung-s95d-qd-oled-tv-announced-glare-free-screen\">S95D</a> — it lacks the glare-free panel found on the newer set — but you still get sharp picture quality and a slew of gaming features, including a 120Hz variable refresh rate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>On paper, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296334/amazon-fire-tv-omni-mini-led-features-specs\">Amazon’s latest <strong>Fire TV Omni TVs</strong></a> are some of the most impressive the company has ever produced. And right now, you can get a 65-inch model for $959.99 ($130 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C1TQYNWX\">Amazon</a>, which matches its all-time low. That’s a fair price for a sharp QLED model that can support 144Hz gaming with Dolby Vision IQ and HDR10 Plus. The Mini LED TV also offers an adaptive, AI-powered feature that can adjust your TV’s settings to match the ambient lighting in your room. Needless to say, it’s your best option if you’re a Fire TV fan looking for an all-in-one solution to access Amazon’s Alexa-powered user experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, February 7th:</strong> Adjusted pricing and added several deals, including those for the LG C3, Samsung’s S90C, and Amazon’s 2024 Fire TV Omni QLED</em>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Missed out on all the terrific TV deals we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday? That’s okay, because the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl have historically been one of the better times of the year to snag a discounted set. In fact, Amazon, Best Buy, Woot, and a number of retailers are already discounting a variety of TV sets ahead of the big game on February 9th. Many of the current promos aren’t Super Bowl-specific, mind you, but there are still some great options if you’re on the hunt for a budget-friendly QLED TV for your viewing party or a gamer-friendly OLED that can serve your entertainment needs year-round.\nWe’ll keep an eye out for more 4K TV deals as we get closer to the big day and update this post accordingly, so be sure to keep checking back in the run-up to Super Bowl LIX.\nLG C4 OLED TV\nIf you’re looking for an OLED TV, LG’s exceptional C4 is currently down to one of its best prices to date. Right now, for instance, you can buy the 65-inch model for about $1,496.99 ($1,203 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. The 77-inch model is also available for around $2,196.99 ($1,503 off) from Amazon, Best Buy, and LG, the latter of which is offering up to $200 off select LG soundbars with your purchase through March 2nd.\nThe C4 offers a bright, vibrant display with the kind of inky blacks that characterize OLED panels, along with support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. The last-gen TV remains an excellent option for gaming, too, with four HDMI 2.1 ports, a 144Hz refresh rate, and support for AMD FreeSync Premium as well as Nvidia G-Sync. It even comes with a Wii-like Magic Remote, which, in many instances, we’ve found to be easier to navigate with than the remote’s arrow keys.\nLG C3 OLED TV\nThe last-gen LG C3 OLED is also still a fantastic television if you can’t quite stretch for the LG C4. Best Buy and Walmart’s current sale price of around $1,669 (about $600 off) on the 77-inch model isn’t quite as good as the $1,500 price tag we saw during a recent flash sale, but it’s still an incredible value for a massive OLED TV that offers a similar experience to the LG C4.\nAlthough LG’s newer flagship can achieve around 1,000 nits of peak brightness before enhancements, the C3 isn’t exactly dim, with a peak HDR brightness of just over 800 nits. LG’s Brightness Booster feature helps push it quite a bit further, too, with an estimated 40 percent improvement. The last-gen TV is capped at a 120Hz variable refresh rate but otherwise boasts many of the same features as the C4, including support for both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. It also runs on LG’s webOS, works with the wand-like Magic Remote, and features a game mode that improves input latency and prevents burn-in.\nLG B4 OLED TV\nIf you’re looking for a more affordable OLED, LG’s entry-level B4 TV is on sale at Best Buy in the 48-inch size starting at just $599.99 ($200 off), matching its all-time low. It’s discounted in larger configurations, too, with the 55-inch going for $999.99 ($400 off) at Best Buy and LG’s online storefront and the 65-inch selling for around $1,296.99 ($200 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and direct from LG.\nThe TV isn’t as bright or powerful as the aforementioned C4 series — it’s outfitted with an older A8 processor, as opposed to LG’s newer A9 chip — but it’s still relatively snappy and slated to receive several more years of webOS updates, ensuring the navigation and user experience should be dialed in for the foreseeable future. It also features a buttery 120Hz refresh rate, four full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 ports, and support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. And like the LG C4, it includes support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\nSony Bravia A95L QD-OLED\nSony’s Bravia A95L is also receiving a steep discount ahead of the Super Bowl. Right now, you can buy the 65-inch model for around $2,998 at Amazon and Best Buy, which matches its Black Friday price. Other sizes are on sale, too, including the 55-inch, which is going for around $2,498 ($300 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.\nThe Sony A95L was arguably the best TV we saw last year, largely due to its vibrant, lifelike picture quality. The bright 4K QD-OLED TV includes support for Dolby Vision and HDR10 as well, along with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, a pair of HDMI 2.1 inputs, and support for Google’s excellent TV platform.\nSamsung OLED S95D TV\nThe Samsung OLED S95D is another terrific OLED set that’s also down to one of its best prices to date in multiple configurations. Right now, for example, you can purchase the 55-inch model for around $1,899.99 ($700) at Amazon, Best Buy and Samsung’s online storefront. The 65-inch panel, meanwhile, is available from Amazon, Best Buy, and Samsung for around $2,299.99 ($1,100 off). If you purchase directly from Samsung, you’ll also be eligible for a discount on select Samsung soundbars, with the exact discount dependent on which model you choose.\nThe S95D comes with a glare-free display that does an excellent job of minimizing unwanted reflections, allowing it to provide rich colors and contrast at high brightness levels. It lacks support for Dolby Vision, but it does offer a 144Hz variable refresh rate, four HDMI 2.1 ports, and support for Alexa and Google Assistant. It also comes with Samsung’s One Connect Box, which lets you connect your gaming console, set-top boxes, and other devices to your TV with a single cable, as opposed to a mess of wires. And, of course, Samsung’s Tizen OS lets you stream from a wide selection of apps, including Netflix, Apple TV Plus, Disney Plus, and Max.\nSamsung Frame TV (2024)\nSamsung’s Frame TV doesn’t offer the pristine image quality found in OLED displays, but it’s unique in that the TV showcases artwork when idle. Combined with its anti-glare matte display, it makes for a stylish 4K TV that looks more akin to a canvas painting than a black void. It’s a shame it doesn’t offer Dolby Vision or VRR support, but it still has a range of solid specs, including a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, HDMI 2.1 support, and compatibility with voice assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant. Just bear in mind, you’ll need to pay for a subscription ($4.99 a month / $49.90 annually) to get unlimited access to all of the artwork available in the Samsung Art Store.\nNow through 1AM ET on February 9th, Woot is offering the best prices we’ve seen on Samsung’s last-gen Frame TV. Right now, for instance, the 55- and 65-inch models are on sale for $867.99 ($630 off) and 1,247.99 ($752 off), respectively, which are all-time lows. Samsung, meanwhile, is discounting the TV through February 9th while offering an additional $50 off its Music Frame speaker or an HW-S700D Dolby Soundbar. The 55-inch model is on sale at Samsung’s online storefront for $899.99 ($600 off) or at Amazon and Best Buy without the aforementioned perks for the same price.\nTCL QM85 TV\nIf you’re looking for something cheaper, TCL makes some excellent budget-friendly 4K TVs, one of which is the TCL QM85. The 2024 flagship is steeply discounted right now, with the 65-inch model going for around $897.99 (about $600 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.

That’s just $100 more than the lowest price we’ve seen on the 4K TV. The 2024 model is only a slight downgrade from the S95D — it lacks the glare-free panel found on the newer set — but you still get sharp picture quality and a slew of gaming features, including a 120Hz variable refresh rate.\nOn paper, Amazon’s latest Fire TV Omni TVs are some of the most impressive the company has ever produced.
