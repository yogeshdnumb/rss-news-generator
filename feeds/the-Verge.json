A smidge over two decades ago, he’d launched a social and link sharing website that, for years, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/24209615/digg-internet-web-2-homepage-2004-kevin-rose-interview\">was known as “the homepage of the internet.”</a> Since then, Digg had been through <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/20/4447920/betaworks-a-startup-studio-doubles-down-on-creating-a-company-of\">several owners</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9470967/digg-dialog-internet-comment-section\">many pivots</a>, Rose had gone on to several other careers, and the internet had moved on. Rose had thought about building something like Digg again, and had even been approached to buy back the domain and website a few times, but the timing had never been right.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This time, though, things started to click. Rose and a group of what he calls “brainstorming partners,” which included Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, design and product exec Justin Mezzell, and even folks like Blogger and Twitter cofounder Ev Williams, started to talk about whether AI might be able to help them build a better social platform. “I would call Alexis up and we would chat,” Rose says, “and we&#8217;d be like, ‘hey, what if, what if, what if?’ And a lot of those things started giving us both that butterflies-in-the-stomach situation, where you&#8217;re like, ‘oh, this could be cool. This could be really cool.’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, Digg is making a comeback. Rose will be its chair, Mezzell its CEO, and Ohanian an adviser. (Both Rose and Ohanian are also venture capitalists now, and their firms are investing in the new venture.) They bought the domain and other assets from Money Group for a price they wouldn’t disclose and are bringing it back. The site is relaunching today, but only in a limited form. Its ultimate ambitions, however, are enormous: Digg aims to build the kind of community-first social platform that basically no longer exists on the internet. And its new founding team thinks AI could be the secret to pulling it off.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/A29E566C-9957-45F6-902F-0B06E9E5A8DC.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.5340314136126,100,92.931937172775\" alt=\"A photo of seven people drinking wine.\" title=\"A photo of seven people drinking wine.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;One from the early Digg days.

Everything is based on content and links: someone shares a link, and people can comment and vote on the links. (If you like something, you “Digg” it; the old “Bury” downvote option is now gone.) The most popular stuff ends up on the homepage — which Rose and Mezzell tell me they hope will once again be the homepage of the internet — but there will also be countless smaller communities surfacing and sharing stuff in their own niche.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are, of course, plenty of ways to talk about links on the internet. One of them, Reddit, continues to be very popular! The team isn’t shy about the comparison but thinks that by better engaging with the community, and without the growth-at-all-costs requirements of being a public company, they can build something that takes better care of its users. If Digg does this right, the homepage will feel like Old Digg, and everything else might feel like Better Reddit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rose says he and Ohanian are both convinced — and both learned the hard way — that the real trick, the thing nobody has yet done properly, is to give the communities the tools they actually need to operate. This is where AI comes in. So much of a moderator’s job, Rose says, is just grunt work: fighting spam, reviewing obvious policy violations, litigating pointless fights. “How can we remove the janitorial work of moderators and community managers,” he says, “and convert what they do every day into more of a kind of ‘director of vibes, culture and community’ than someone that is just sitting there doing the laborious crappy stuff that comes in through the front door?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The real trick is to give the communities the tools they actually need to operate</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new Digg, Rose says, will include lots of AI-forward ways to sort through and make decisions on content. He also hopes AI can be used for fun. “I&#8217;m just making stuff up here, but there&#8217;s everything from an AI agent that converts your entire sub-community into Klingon, to another one where you don’t allow a certain type of profanity and that’s automatically auto-moderated.” Users will be able to tap AI models to build stuff right in their communities, too. “If we can create more of a dynamic canvas where agents are layered on top to assist, to help, to do wild things, to create games, to do whatever that community wants them to do, then we have something,” Rose says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new Digg, if the team does it right, should feel more like a community-driven art project than an old-school internet forum. But Rose and Mezzell both say the whole thing depends on doing what users want — and nothing else. “One of the things that I believe that made Digg, and makes Reddit, a special place on the internet,” Rose says, “is that there are humans behind the scenes with real opinions, real conversation, real stories that they find interesting. The second you start to sterilize that, you’re just an aggregator of information. You’re a fancy RSS reader with some voting on it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One big challenge, Mezzell says, is figuring out how to reward and promote users for doing good work. Digg won’t show how many followers you have because that creates bad incentives; same with competing to be the most-“Dugg” person on the platform. “There are all these very simple systems that we already have, for commenting systems and branching and all that stuff. But even if we start there, we cannot stop asking the question about how to give people the respect for being really insightful, for being really encouraging, for being really funny.” He doesn’t have a perfect answer for it yet, but he knows that’s key to making it work.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s a lot more that the new Digg team doesn’t have a perfect answer for yet. Rose and Mezzell both say, a few times each, that what’s launching today is essentially a prototype. It’ll have a homepage, a few sub-communities, some links, some comments, and that’s about it. The goal is to get people excited that Digg is back, and then both introduce them to the new platform and build it alongside them. “If you come on day one,” Rose says, it&#8217;s 99.9 percent nostalgia and you&#8217;re like, damn, this is like a slightly updated version of Digg that looks really cool.” Give it some time — maybe even just a few weeks, if the new team ships as fast as Mezzell promises — and it’ll be something different.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"The new Digg looks a lot more like 2025 than 2005. | Image: Digg\n\nSometime last fall, Kevin Rose started thinking seriously about Digg again.

The dual-motor all-wheel drive version can put out 330kW (442hp) of power and 494 lb-ft of torque.

The 800-volt system is unique in Volvo’s lineup, but it’s comparable to other fast-charging EVs, like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24308950/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-review-price-specs-photos\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23680537/kia-ev6-gt-review-ev-specs-price-photos\">Kia EV6</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The acceleration specs sound impressive, with a zero to 60mph time of 3.9 seconds for the Performance trim.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The overall profile is tall and slightly boxy.

(Polestar and Volvo are essentially cousins, both operating under the umbrella of parent company Geely.)

The front end resembles the EX90, featuring Volvo’s signature “Thor’s hammer” LED headlights, with new C-shaped LED lights in the rear. There’s ample cargo space, with 424 liters of room that can grow to 733 liters with the rear seats folded down. The ES90 also features a 22-liter frunk (front trunk) for charging cable storage. The panoramic roof is electrochromic for adjustable transparency on sunny days, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like other Volvo EVs, the ES90 features Google’s built-in infotainment system, which includes native apps like Google Maps, Google Assistant, and Google Play. Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Cockpit Platform powers the 5G system. And the five-inch instrument cluster resides alongside a larger 14.5-inch center screen display.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like the EX90 SUV, the ES90 is built on Volvo’s new Superset tech stack, which includes dual Nvidia computers with the ability to perform 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This will come in handy when managing functionalities such as “AI-based, state-of-the-art active safety features, car sensors and efficient battery management.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>The ES90’s roofline is sleek, its door handles flush, and it has a lidar sensor mounted on the roof.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ES90 is built on Volvo’s SPA2 architecture and will be the second vehicle, after the EX90, to be based on the Superset tech stack. Superset is a modular engineering platform that the company says will be used to make safer cars more efficiently and to improve them over time through over-the-air software updates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is Volvo’s sixth all-electric vehicle, joining the EX90 SUV, EM90 van (China only), EX40 SUV, EC40 crossover, and EX30 compact SUV. The Swedish automaker had said it would be 100 percent EV sales by 2030, but it recently updated that timeline to reflect the global slowdown in EV sales. Volvo is now saying that it will rely on a mix of hybrids and battery-electric vehicles to reach its new goal of selling “90 to 100 percent&#8230; electrified models” by 2030.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ES90 is an interesting addition, especially considering most US automakers have dropped sedans from their lineups in favor of trucks and SUVs. Volvo is hoping its electric sedan can fill a gap in the market, though it could prove difficult. Volkswagen recently canceled plans to sell its own electric sedan, the ID.7, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/601262/volkswagen-cancels-id-7-sedan-for-us\">in the US</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ES90 will join the recently facelifted gas-powered S90 sedan, which starts in the US at around $59,000. Starting today, the EV version is available to order in most European countries, though Volvo has yet to announce when it will be available in the US. &nbsp;The automaker also did not disclose the price. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We will share additional details on the US ES90 offer at a later date, closer to customer deliveries,” Volvo spokesperson Sophia Durr said. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"No word on when the ES90 will make it to the US. | Image: Volvo\n\nVolvo has pulled back the curtain on its upcoming ES90 electric sedan with 434 miles of range and a tech stack that includes Nvidia’s powerful Drive AGX Orin computer in a dual setup.\nVolvo has been trickling news out about the ES90 over the past several weeks, but today’s announcement includes our first full look at the sedan and a full rundown on its specs, including an 800-volt architecture for fast charging and the aforementioned Nvidia system-on-a-chip.\nThe ES90 boasts Volvo’s longest range, fastest charging speed, and most advanced computing system of all its vehicles.

This will come in handy when managing functionalities such as “AI-based, state-of-the-art active safety features, car sensors and efficient battery management.” \n\nThe ES90’s roofline is sleek, its door handles flush, and it has a lidar sensor mounted on the roof.\n\n\nThe ES90 is built on Volvo’s SPA2 architecture and will be the second vehicle, after the EX90, to be based on the Superset tech stack. Superset is a modular engineering platform that the company says will be used to make safer cars more efficiently and to improve them over time through over-the-air software updates.\nThis is Volvo’s sixth all-electric vehicle, joining the EX90 SUV, EM90 van (China only), EX40 SUV, EC40 crossover, and EX30 compact SUV. The Swedish automaker had said it would be 100 percent EV sales by 2030, but it recently updated that timeline to reflect the global slowdown in EV sales. Volvo is now saying that it will rely on a mix of hybrids and battery-electric vehicles to reach its new goal of selling “90 to 100 percent… electrified models” by 2030. \nThe ES90 is an interesting addition, especially considering most US automakers have dropped sedans from their lineups in favor of trucks and SUVs. Volvo is hoping its electric sedan can fill a gap in the market, though it could prove difficult. Volkswagen recently canceled plans to sell its own electric sedan, the ID.7, in the US.\nThe ES90 will join the recently facelifted gas-powered S90 sedan, which starts in the US at around $59,000. Starting today, the EV version is available to order in most European countries, though Volvo has yet to announce when it will be available in the US.  The automaker also did not disclose the price. \n“We will share additional details on the US ES90 offer at a later date, closer to customer deliveries,” Volvo spokesperson Sophia Durr said.","summary":"Volvo has pulled back the curtain on its upcoming ES90 electric sedan with 434 miles of range and a tech stack that includes Nvidia’s powerful Drive AGX Orin computer in a dual setup. Volvo has been trickling news out about the ES90 over the past several weeks, but today’s announcement includes our first full look [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/?p=623945","isoDate":"2025-03-05T10:10:00.000Z"},{"title":"Cadillac&#8217;s new electric Escalade IQL will be the longest SUV in production","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/624127/cadillac-escalade-iql-electric-longest-suv-more-cargo-storage","pubDate":"2025-03-05T05:01:00.000Z","author":"Umar Shakir","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"The Escalade IQL has a boxier rear-end.\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/MY26_Cadillac_Escalade_IQL_LUX_1AP_6404-1.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption>The Escalade IQL has a boxier rear-end.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Cadillac is taking its large and can-charge electric Escalade IQ and making it just a longer to accommodate some more luggage and leg room for third-row passengers.

Now there are more good options than ever.</p>\n\n<p>But the market is fragmented. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24156161/wear-os-5-google-io-smartwatch\">Wear OS 5</a> is here for Samsung’s Galaxy Watches, Google’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Pixel Watch 3</a>, and soon, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/612965\">OnePlus Watch 3</a> when it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/618894/oneplus-watch-3-delayed-typo\">ships next month</a>. However, the larger ecosystem is catching up. Some features, like Google Assistant, are not yet available on certain Wear OS 3 smartwatches, and Wear OS 4 still isn’t widely available. Even so, the Android wearable ecosystem is barreling ahead.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Processor</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Android smartwatches have long been foiled by outdated processors. Is the chip under the hood powerful enough to run Wear OS or the platform’s own proprietary operating system smoothly?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Ecosystem</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Does a watch work better within one company’s product ecosystem versus another?

However, they’re not all capable of controlling your smart home, contactless payments, or interacting with digital assistants.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Support</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Is this device likely to last you a while, or will you need to upgrade sooner than you’d like?

If not, does it support quick charging?</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>If you’d rather wait until Wear OS settles down a bit, there are platform-agnostic smartwatches and fitness watches you can buy in the meantime. Otherwise, you’ll want to be aware of the chip and Wear OS version powering your watch. Mobvoi, for instance, has generally been a step behind Google and Samsung in rolling out the latest version of Wear OS. Meanwhile, you might want to pay attention to whether a watch is running the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus or the base W5 chip. The W5 Plus has some extra processing advantages, but for the record, the base chip isn&#8217;t bad. The Pixel Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 2 both sport the W5 and have notably improved performance and battery life.</p>\n\n<p>So long as you keep the aforementioned caveats in mind, Android users have more smartwatch options than ever before. I’ve rounded up my top picks, but if none of these is the right fit, you can always check out our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22985108/best-fitness-tracker\">fitness tracker buying guide</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"EgHqZo\">Best smartwatch for Samsung phones</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;43mm, 47mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;77g, 85g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 30 hours with AOD, 40 without AOD /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:&nbsp;</strong>Always-on OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:&nbsp;</strong>Built-in GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 50 meters, IP68 /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;16GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you have a Samsung phone, you’ll get the most mileage out of a Samsung smartwatch. And of the four watches Samsung has in its current lineup, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Although Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch 7 in August, there wasn’t a refresh for the Classic. That means you ought to be seeing some good deals for the Classic soon, if not already. It’s not often that I recommend a last-gen device, but such is my deep love for the physical rotating bezel.</p>\n\n<p>If you want the latest and greatest, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch 7</a> offers an upgraded 3nm Exynos W1000 chip and a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor. It’s a marginal improvement over the 2023 models, but I don’t feel like Samsung introduced anything last year that requires having them. It also has Wear OS 5 and One UI 6 Watch, though Samsung <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300468/samsung-wear-os-5-one-ui-6-watch-smartwatch-wearables\">is rolling out the newer OS to older watches</a> (including the Galaxy Watch 6). Mostly, I recommend the 7 if you prefer a smaller size, don’t care about the rotating bezel, and want something a smidge more futureproof.</p>\n\n<p>The Classic’s rotating bezel is 15 percent thinner than the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The updated design is sleeker than its predecessor, and the larger display is easier on the eyes and is only slightly bigger at 43mm and 47mm. I have small wrists, but the 47mm was still quite comfortable for everyday wear. It’s launching with Wear OS 4, which adds extended battery life, and — finally — cloud backups. One UI 5 Watch also adds some minor health and sleep tracking improvements, but this will eventually make its way to older models. While I prefer the Classic, the base Watch 6 model may be the better option if you want a smaller, lighter, sleeker, and cheaper smartwatch.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24816190/236731_Samsung_Galaxy_Watch_6_AKrales_0180.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic on top of a tennis racket\" title=\"Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 and Watch 6 Classic on top of a tennis racket\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 40mm Galaxy Watch 6 and the 47mm Watch 6 Classic are iterative updates, but deliver a familiar yet elevated experience.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>For more outdoorsy folks, the $649.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> might be the more sensible choice. Of all Samsung’s watches, it has the best battery life, lasting around three days in our testing. (Though, we never got the full 100-hour estimated battery life.) It’s got dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, increased durability, 10ATM of water resistance, and a Quick Button, which acts as a customizable shortcut button. It’s basically an Apple Watch Ultra for Android.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, if you’re on a budget, there’s the new $199.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24176939/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-price-specs\">Galaxy Watch FE</a>, which is essentially a rebadged Galaxy Watch 4.</p>\n\n<p>The Samsung Health app also delivers a good overall fitness tracking experience, especially since you can enable turn-by-turn navigation for hiking and<strong> </strong>cycling activities. We weren’t too impressed with nightly SpO2 readings, but Samsung’s overall sleep tracking continues to improve. You also get built-in GPS, body composition analysis, irregular heart rate notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS features, and EKGs. Most recently, Samsung added a new Energy score, AI-powered wellness insights, FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, and a confusing AGEs Index metric for metabolic health. While the Energy score is broadly accurate, I found the AI-generated features to be hit or miss and the AGEs Index to be more gimmicky than useful. The latter feature is also limited to the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra.</p>\n\n<p>We don’t necessarily recommend the Galaxy Watches if you don’t have a Samsung phone. EKGs and sleep apnea detection<strong> </strong>require the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is limited to Samsung phones. You can work around it, but all Samsung watches work <em>best</em> with other Samsung devices.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"TFwXTK\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23818557/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review-bezels-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full Galaxy Watch 6 series review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"uuXdb5\">Best Android smartwatch for non-Samsung users</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;41mm, 45mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;31g for 41mm, 37g for 45mm /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Roughly 24 hours with AOD enabled /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:&nbsp;</strong>Always-on OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:&nbsp;</strong>Built-in GPS&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Safety Signal with Fitbit Premium /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $349.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is done playing catch-up. It’s an annoying truth that if you have a Samsung phone, a Samsung smartwatch is probably the best choice for you. However, for everyone else, I highly recommend the Pixel Watch 3.</p>\n\n<p>There are several updates to the Pixel Watch 3, but the gist is that it’s a more refined watch that also expands into new territory. One major update is that there are now two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. You get extra screen real estate on the larger watch, but the bezels are also smaller on the 41mm model. (If you’re trying to pick between sizes, I prefer the 45mm.) The displays are brighter as well, ranging from a minimum of 1 nit to a maximum of 2,000 nits.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25610299/247234_Pixel_Watch_3_AKrales_0205.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"The 45mm and 41mm Pixel Watch 3 in colorful boxes\" title=\"The 45mm and 41mm Pixel Watch 3 in colorful boxes\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 45mm model also wears small. The difference between the two sizes isn’t massive as far as wearability.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Health and fitness also get several updates, especially for runners. There’s a new Cardio Load metric that gauges the cardiovascular intensity of the exercises you’ve been doing over a set period of time. It’s similar to Garmin’s Training Load metric. You’re also given a Cardio Load target based on your fitness goals, readiness, and current activity. Runners also get a new dashboard full of form analysis metrics as well as the ability to program custom workouts. In addition, you can get AI-generated suggested workouts. And if you’re in Europe, the Pixel Watch 3 can now detect if you no longer have a pulse and call emergency services.</p>\n\n<p>The Pixel Watch 3 also adds a bunch of nifty Google integrations. It’s excellent if you have a Google-powered smart home because you can now directly view and interact with your Nest Doorbell or camera feeds. You can also use the watch as a remote for your Google TV, and there are new Google Home Tile / complications that make controlling your home from your wrist a breeze. Also new are offline Google Maps, the ability to unlock Pixel phones, and a Call Assist feature that lets a caller know you need an extra minute to pick up your phone.</p>\n\n<p>That said, while the Pixel Watch was initially framed as a watch for any Android phone, several updates this time around mean you’ll get the best experience with a Pixel phone. But compared to Samsung, there isn’t quite as much lock-in. Health features, for example, are available to everyone so long as you have a Fitbit account. Extra good news: Google removed certain metrics, like the Daily Readiness Score, from the Fitbit Premium paywall. Mostly, the features locked to Pixel phones are the Recorder app and things like the ability to unlock your phone with the watch.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to be mindful of is durability. While the domed display is beautiful, we cracked the screen on the original Pixel Watch <em>and</em> got deep scratches on the Pixel Watch 2. (Thankfully, we haven’t messed up the Pixel Watch 3.) Google doesn’t offer any repair options, but you can get the Preferred Care extended warranty if you want to be prepared should something happen. It’s not ideal since it’s limited to the US and Canada, but it’s a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"7hi5hI\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Read my full Google Pixel Watch 3 review</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"XToLsa\">Best alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;47mm with 22mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;49g case, 80g with strap /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 100 hours in smart mode, 48 with AOD on, and 12 days in power-saving mode /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Dual-frequency GPS, Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, QZSS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $299.99 OnePlus Watch 2 is what a glow-up looks like. While the original <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features\">OnePlus Watch</a> was horrible, this watch helps fill the void that Fossil left when it said it was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/26/24052275/fossil-quitting-smartwatches-android-wear-os\">pulling out of Android smartwatches</a> — namely, a viable alternative to Google and Samsung.</p>\n\n<p>The 47mm case is big for petite wrists, and unfortunately, it only comes in one size, but it’s made of durable stainless steel and sapphire crystal. Plus, it houses a 500mAh battery. That, plus a dual-chip architecture and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/26/24081349/wear-os-4-oneplus-hybrid-wearables-smartwatches\">novel dual OS system</a>, results in super long battery life. How long a smartwatch lasts will, of course, depend on your individual usage, but I got nearly four days with normal use. That’s incredible for a flagship.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25379979/247069_Oneplus_watch_2_AKrales_0125.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close-up of the OnePlus Watch 2 on a red book\" title=\"Close-up of the OnePlus Watch 2 on a red book\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus Watch 2 has stupendous battery life.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>It also has Wear OS 4, making it the only third-party Wear OS watch running the latest software. It has Google Assistant from the get-go — a big achievement since that’s been a problem with other third-party Android watches. Plus, you get access to the Google Play Store for a robust app ecosystem. On the fitness side of things, OnePlus added dual-frequency GPS. That’s a plus if you’re outdoorsy and frequent challenging GPS environments like dense forests or crowded cities.</p>\n\n<p>The main things you’re giving up are LTE connectivity and some features like EKGs, atrial fibrillation detection, native period tracking, and fall detection. The lack of cellular is a bummer, as it means you really should keep your phone on you when you’re out and about. Still, the $300 price tag is a competitive one and may be worth the trade-off given battery life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, OnePlus also recently announced the OnePlus Watch 3, which will have Wear OS 5, a rotating crown that actually scrolls, better battery life, an improved GPS antenna, and a bunch of new health features. I’m still in the process of testing it, so stay tuned for that review. (In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/e/612965\">here’s my hands-on</a>.) You might want to keep in mind, however, that the Watch 3 is $30 more expensive. On the bright side, this also means we’ll probably see discounts on the remaining OnePlus Watch 2 inventory in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"a88jY6\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables\">Read my full OnePlus Watch 2 review</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kw7Yhq\">Best fitness smartwatch for Android</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;50mm with 24mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;44.3g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 80 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen and secondary ultra-low power display /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, Beidou /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Mobvoi’s TicWatch lineup has its devoted fans for a reason: super long battery life. The $249.99 TicWatch Pro 5 is no exception. It’s got an estimated 80 hours of battery life with standard use, a secondary ultra-low power display, and a massive (for a smartwatch you wear on your wrist, at least) 628mAh battery. I didn’t quite get 80 hours in my testing, but I did get a solid 48-60 hours with heavy GPS use. That outclasses most of the watches in this category (except the OnePluS Watch 2) and is useful for backpackers and endurance athletes. It might not hold a candle to a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22883556/garmin-fenix-7-epix-gps-smartwatches-outdoors-fitness\">top-of-the-line Garmin</a>, but it’s also a smarter watch for a fraction of the price.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life aside, the Pro 5 is a good option for fitness-focused people who aren’t keen on giving up smart capabilities for a Garmin or Polar. It’s also more durable. This time around, Mobvoi has also added a digital crown so you don’t have to worry about scrolling through menus with sweaty fingers. The flatter side button also reduces the risk of accidental presses.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24666161/236670_Mobvoi_TicWatch_Pro_5_AKrales_0091.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close up of the ULP display on the TicWatch Pro 5\" title=\"Close up of the ULP display on the TicWatch Pro 5\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The ULP display helps to extend battery life.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelias Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelias Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Pro 5 also has an ingenious method of displaying heart rate. When you lift up your arm, the backlight changes color depending on which heart rate zone you’re in. That means you can instantly gauge whether to up the intensity or slow your roll. The Pro 5 also adds new training metrics, like VO2 Max and recovery time.</p>\n\n<p>The TicWatch supports stress tracking, all-day blood oxygen monitoring, fatigue assessments, as well as atrial fibrillation and irregular heartbeat detection. For outdoorsy types, it also has access to multiple GNSS systems, and there’s a new barometer and compass app, as well as a one-tap measurement app that gives you a quick look at five metrics (heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, respiratory rate, and overall heart health).</p>\n\n<p>It’s also pretty capable on the productivity front. You get contactless payments, access to the Play Store, notifications, and the ability to take calls. It’s also the only Android smartwatch available in the US with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus chip, which is a plus in terms of futureproofing. The only major concerns are the 50mm case that may not suit smaller wrists and the lack of a digital assistant.</p>\n\n<p>And good news! <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235843/at-long-last-wear-os-4-arrives-on-mobvoi-ticwatches\">Mobvoi announced</a> the rollout of Wear OS 4 in September, meaning all Pro 5 devices should be running the newer operating system at this point.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KumW6f\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23733359/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-review-wear-os-3-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 review</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xyqJ1r\">Best hybrid smartwatch</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;37mm with 18mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;45g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 39 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED display /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Tethered GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Hybrid smartwatches are an excellent way to keep things simple and subtle. The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light gets you the basics like push notifications, timers, and alarms. On the health front, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS workouts. (That said, GPS is tethered from your phone, not built in.) The design reminds me of a classier Swatch, particularly if you get the more colorful options in a minty green or pale blue. But the big reason the Light has dethroned our previous pick, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22882401/garmin-vivomove-sport-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-wearables\">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a>, is its extra-long battery life. Withings estimates it lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, and I got pretty close to that in testing with 25 days. Despite the Vivomove’s more appealing $180 price tag, it only lasts about five days.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25282437/247014_Withings_ScanWatch_2_Light_AKrales_0117.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Overhead view of person wearing Withings ScanWatch 2 and ScanWatch Light\" title=\"Overhead view of person wearing Withings ScanWatch 2 and ScanWatch Light\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch 2 (left) is a fancier version of the Light and has a few more health features.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>If you want a bit more out of a hybrid, you can also opt for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Withings-ScanWatch-Monitoring-Fitness-Compatible/dp/B0DJFWPCM9\">ScanWatch 2</a>. It’s an extra $100, but you get EKGs and atrial fibrillation detection, temperature sensors, SpO2 readings, and an altimeter for measuring elevation. It also looks a bit more elegant on the wrist, partly because of a secondary dial that tracks your daily step progress.</p>\n\n<p>If neither matches your style, the Vivomove Sport is still a good option that gets you access to Garmin’s in-depth platform. Its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23600040/garmin-vivomove-trend-review-hybrid-smartwatch-wearable\">Vivomove Trend</a> is a slightly more upscale option that also supports Qi charging.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"mq3RA5\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24085043/withings-scanwatch-2-scanwatch-light-review-wearables-smartwatch\">Read my full Withings ScanWatch Light review</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"EC2Hom\">Best platform-agnostic fitness smartwatch</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;41mm with 18mm straps; 45mm with 22mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;8GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Garmin is best known for making rugged GPS watches that have excellent fitness features but aren’t so smart otherwise.

Like its predecessor, the Venu 2 Plus, it also has a microphone and speaker so you can take and make calls directly from the wrist. It also has a clever workaround for digital assistants —&nbsp;it uses Bluetooth to work with whatever assistant is already on your phone. You’d think more fitness trackers would do this, but they don’t. It worked well in testing, though digital assistants aren’t always the smartest at understanding commands.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25047640/236839_Garmin_Venu_3_AKrales_0153.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Person wearing the Garmin Venu 3S while putting their hand in a jeans pocket.\" title=\"Person wearing the Garmin Venu 3S while putting their hand in a jeans pocket.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Venu 3 series is a little pricey, but it’s the smartest watch Garmin’s got to offer.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Venu 3 doesn’t have the best third-party app ecosystem, but it has Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music for offline playback. Android users can also send quick responses for texts, and the watch works with either iOS or Android for folks who want to keep their options open. It also has fall detection, live tracking, and contactless payments.</p>\n\n<p>As for health features, it has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables its FDA-cleared EKG app to detect atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, you get built-in GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, all of the advanced coaching features in the Garmin Connect app, and Garmin’s famous in-depth health data. The Venu 3 also improves sleep tracking with nap detection and adds audio-guided meditation sessions. There’s also a new wheelchair mode.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t the most hardcore Garmin that money can buy, but it’s definitely the smartest. The price is a bit high compared to most smartwatches, but by Garmin standards, it’s middle-of-the-pack.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Rjsnul\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23982519/garmin-venu-3s-review-smartwatch-sleep-tracking-wearable\">Read my full Garmin Venu 3S review</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ZB61wf\">Best budget Android smartwatch</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><em><em><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;43mm w/ 20mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;29.5g for standard, 31.7g for premium /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 10 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Five GNSS systems /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;</em>N/A</em></em></em></p>\n\n<p>Amazfit’s made a name for itself making budget wearables that punch far above their weight. The $99.99 Amazfit Active 2 is no exception.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The Active 2 is a surprisingly spiffy watch considering its price. The standard version has a stainless steel case with tempered glass, and if you shell out $30 extra, you can get the premium model with sapphire crystal and an extra leather strap. Normally I don’t get compliments while wearing budget smartwatches, but I got <em>several</em> while wearing this one. </p>\n\n<p>While it doesn’t run Wear OS, its proprietary Zepp OS makes for a platform-agnostic smartwatch. Feature-wise, you get all the basics and then some. That includes things like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. You also get offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation, 160 different sport activity profiles, and a new strength training activity that automatically tracks reps. The Active 2 doesn’t have dual-frequency GPS, but it has the next best thing: access to all five of the major GNSS satellite systems. As far as health tracking goes, it also emphasizes trendy metrics like a readiness score and has a revamped sleep tracking algorithm. Battery life is estimated at about 10 days, though as a heavy user, I got around eight to nine in my testing. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257523_Amazfit_Active_2_AKrales_0080.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;This watch got me several compliments, which I don’t usually expect at this price point.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Something that sets the Active 2 apart at this price range is access to an AI assistant on wrist and AI chatbots within the Zepp app. The Zepp Flow assistant (on wrist) is a little finicky, but you can use it to control your watch’s on-device settings and basic queries like asking for the weather. The Zepp Aura AI bot costs an extra $77 yearly, and you can ask it to deliver insights into your readiness and sleep scores. I found it hit or miss, but at least it’s well-integrated into the app, snappy, and most importantly, optional. More useful is the Zepp Coach, which you can use to generate custom training plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All in all, I don’t have much to gripe about this watch, which is wild given how affordable it is. It certainly delivers an outsized bang for your buck.

We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy. It also means evaluating how easy they are to pair, how annoying are notifications, and in the case of Android watches, checking to see if features are universally available across different phone makers (i.e., do all the Galaxy Watch features work if you have a Pixel phone?) Some factors we consider in our rankings are durability, performance, accuracy versus consistency in metrics, and of course, battery life.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, March 4th: </strong>Adjusted pricing/availability and added pros/cons to several watches.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"After a long stretch of slim pickings, the last couple of years have been huge for Android smartwatches. Now there are more good options than ever.\nBut the market is fragmented. Wear OS 5 is here for Samsung’s Galaxy Watches, Google’s Pixel Watch 3, and soon, the OnePlus Watch 3 when it ships next month. However, the larger ecosystem is catching up. Some features, like Google Assistant, are not yet available on certain Wear OS 3 smartwatches, and Wear OS 4 still isn’t widely available. Even so, the Android wearable ecosystem is barreling ahead.\n\n\nProcessor\nAndroid smartwatches have long been foiled by outdated processors. Is the chip under the hood powerful enough to run Wear OS or the platform’s own proprietary operating system smoothly?\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem\nDoes a watch work better within one company’s product ecosystem versus another? Will you have to buy a new watch if you switch phones?\n\n\n\nSmart features\nThese days, most wearables are capable fitness trackers. However, they’re not all capable of controlling your smart home, contactless payments, or interacting with digital assistants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport\nIs this device likely to last you a while, or will you need to upgrade sooner than you’d like? How communicative is the OEM about forthcoming changes?\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life\nCan you get through the day without reaching for a charger? If not, does it support quick charging?\n\n\nIf you’d rather wait until Wear OS settles down a bit, there are platform-agnostic smartwatches and fitness watches you can buy in the meantime. Otherwise, you’ll want to be aware of the chip and Wear OS version powering your watch. Mobvoi, for instance, has generally been a step behind Google and Samsung in rolling out the latest version of Wear OS. Meanwhile, you might want to pay attention to whether a watch is running the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus or the base W5 chip. The W5 Plus has some extra processing advantages, but for the record, the base chip isn’t bad. The Pixel Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 2 both sport the W5 and have notably improved performance and battery life.\nSo long as you keep the aforementioned caveats in mind, Android users have more smartwatch options than ever before. I’ve rounded up my top picks, but if none of these is the right fit, you can always check out our fitness tracker buying guide.\nBest smartwatch for Samsung phones\nSizes: 43mm, 47mm / Weight: 77g, 85g / Battery life: Up to 30 hours with AOD, 40 without AOD / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters, IP68 / Music storage: 16GB\nIf you have a Samsung phone, you’ll get the most mileage out of a Samsung smartwatch. And of the four watches Samsung has in its current lineup, I recommend the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic. Although Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch 7 in August, there wasn’t a refresh for the Classic. That means you ought to be seeing some good deals for the Classic soon, if not already. It’s not often that I recommend a last-gen device, but such is my deep love for the physical rotating bezel.\nIf you want the latest and greatest, the Galaxy Watch 7 offers an upgraded 3nm Exynos W1000 chip and a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor. It’s a marginal improvement over the 2023 models, but I don’t feel like Samsung introduced anything last year that requires having them. It also has Wear OS 5 and One UI 6 Watch, though Samsung is rolling out the newer OS to older watches (including the Galaxy Watch 6). Mostly, I recommend the 7 if you prefer a smaller size, don’t care about the rotating bezel, and want something a smidge more futureproof.\nThe Classic’s rotating bezel is 15 percent thinner than the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic. The updated design is sleeker than its predecessor, and the larger display is easier on the eyes and is only slightly bigger at 43mm and 47mm. I have small wrists, but the 47mm was still quite comfortable for everyday wear. It’s launching with Wear OS 4, which adds extended battery life, and — finally — cloud backups. One UI 5 Watch also adds some minor health and sleep tracking improvements, but this will eventually make its way to older models. While I prefer the Classic, the base Watch 6 model may be the better option if you want a smaller, lighter, sleeker, and cheaper smartwatch.\nFor more outdoorsy folks, the $649.99 Galaxy Watch Ultra might be the more sensible choice. Of all Samsung’s watches, it has the best battery life, lasting around three days in our testing. (Though, we never got the full 100-hour estimated battery life.) It’s got dual-frequency GPS, a new multisport activity, an emergency siren, increased durability, 10ATM of water resistance, and a Quick Button, which acts as a customizable shortcut button. It’s basically an Apple Watch Ultra for Android.\nMeanwhile, if you’re on a budget, there’s the new $199.99 Galaxy Watch FE, which is essentially a rebadged Galaxy Watch 4.\nThe Samsung Health app also delivers a good overall fitness tracking experience, especially since you can enable turn-by-turn navigation for hiking and cycling activities. We weren’t too impressed with nightly SpO2 readings, but Samsung’s overall sleep tracking continues to improve. You also get built-in GPS, body composition analysis, irregular heart rate notifications, fall detection, emergency SOS features, and EKGs. Most recently, Samsung added a new Energy score, AI-powered wellness insights, FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, and a confusing AGEs Index metric for metabolic health. While the Energy score is broadly accurate, I found the AI-generated features to be hit or miss and the AGEs Index to be more gimmicky than useful. The latter feature is also limited to the Galaxy Watch 7 and Ultra.\nWe don’t necessarily recommend the Galaxy Watches if you don’t have a Samsung phone. EKGs and sleep apnea detection require the Samsung Health Monitor app, which is limited to Samsung phones. You can work around it, but all Samsung watches work best with other Samsung devices.\nRead my full Galaxy Watch 6 series review.\nBest Android smartwatch for non-Samsung users\nSizes: 41mm, 45mm / Weight: 31g for 41mm, 37g for 45mm / Battery life: Roughly 24 hours with AOD enabled / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Safety Signal with Fitbit Premium / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nThe $349.99 Google Pixel Watch 3 is done playing catch-up. It’s an annoying truth that if you have a Samsung phone, a Samsung smartwatch is probably the best choice for you. However, for everyone else, I highly recommend the Pixel Watch 3.\nThere are several updates to the Pixel Watch 3, but the gist is that it’s a more refined watch that also expands into new territory. One major update is that there are now two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. You get extra screen real estate on the larger watch, but the bezels are also smaller on the 41mm model. (If you’re trying to pick between sizes, I prefer the 45mm.) The displays are brighter as well, ranging from a minimum of 1 nit to a maximum of 2,000 nits.\nHealth and fitness also get several updates, especially for runners. There’s a new Cardio Load metric that gauges the cardiovascular intensity of the exercises you’ve been doing over a set period of time. It’s similar to Garmin’s Training Load metric. You’re also given a Cardio Load target based on your fitness goals, readiness, and current activity. Runners also get a new dashboard full of form analysis metrics as well as the ability to program custom workouts. In addition, you can get AI-generated suggested workouts. And if you’re in Europe, the Pixel Watch 3 can now detect if you no longer have a pulse and call emergency services.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 also adds a bunch of nifty Google integrations. It’s excellent if you have a Google-powered smart home because you can now directly view and interact with your Nest Doorbell or camera feeds. You can also use the watch as a remote for your Google TV, and there are new Google Home Tile / complications that make controlling your home from your wrist a breeze. Also new are offline Google Maps, the ability to unlock Pixel phones, and a Call Assist feature that lets a caller know you need an extra minute to pick up your phone.\nThat said, while the Pixel Watch was initially framed as a watch for any Android phone, several updates this time around mean you’ll get the best experience with a Pixel phone. But compared to Samsung, there isn’t quite as much lock-in. Health features, for example, are available to everyone so long as you have a Fitbit account. Extra good news: Google removed certain metrics, like the Daily Readiness Score, from the Fitbit Premium paywall. Mostly, the features locked to Pixel phones are the Recorder app and things like the ability to unlock your phone with the watch.\nOne thing to be mindful of is durability. While the domed display is beautiful, we cracked the screen on the original Pixel Watch and got deep scratches on the Pixel Watch 2. (Thankfully, we haven’t messed up the Pixel Watch 3.) Google doesn’t offer any repair options, but you can get the Preferred Care extended warranty if you want to be prepared should something happen. It’s not ideal since it’s limited to the US and Canada, but it’s a step in the right direction.\nRead my full Google Pixel Watch 3 review.\nBest alternative to Google and Samsung smartwatches\nSizes: 47mm with 22mm straps / Weight: 49g case, 80g with strap / Battery life: Up to 100 hours in smart mode, 48 with AOD on, and 12 days in power-saving mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: Dual-frequency GPS, Beidou, GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, QZSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nThe $299.99 OnePlus Watch 2 is what a glow-up looks like. While the original OnePlus Watch was horrible, this watch helps fill the void that Fossil left when it said it was pulling out of Android smartwatches — namely, a viable alternative to Google and Samsung.\nThe 47mm case is big for petite wrists, and unfortunately, it only comes in one size, but it’s made of durable stainless steel and sapphire crystal. Plus, it houses a 500mAh battery. That, plus a dual-chip architecture and novel dual OS system, results in super long battery life. How long a smartwatch lasts will, of course, depend on your individual usage, but I got nearly four days with normal use. That’s incredible for a flagship.\nIt also has Wear OS 4, making it the only third-party Wear OS watch running the latest software. It has Google Assistant from the get-go — a big achievement since that’s been a problem with other third-party Android watches. Plus, you get access to the Google Play Store for a robust app ecosystem. On the fitness side of things, OnePlus added dual-frequency GPS. That’s a plus if you’re outdoorsy and frequent challenging GPS environments like dense forests or crowded cities.\nThe main things you’re giving up are LTE connectivity and some features like EKGs, atrial fibrillation detection, native period tracking, and fall detection. The lack of cellular is a bummer, as it means you really should keep your phone on you when you’re out and about. Still, the $300 price tag is a competitive one and may be worth the trade-off given battery life.\nThat said, OnePlus also recently announced the OnePlus Watch 3, which will have Wear OS 5, a rotating crown that actually scrolls, better battery life, an improved GPS antenna, and a bunch of new health features. I’m still in the process of testing it, so stay tuned for that review. (In the meantime, here’s my hands-on.) You might want to keep in mind, however, that the Watch 3 is $30 more expensive. On the bright side, this also means we’ll probably see discounts on the remaining OnePlus Watch 2 inventory in the coming weeks.\nRead my full OnePlus Watch 2 review.\nBest fitness smartwatch for Android\nSizes: 50mm with 24mm straps / Weight: 44.3g / Battery life: Up to 80 hours / Display type: OLED touchscreen and secondary ultra-low power display / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, Beidou / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nMobvoi’s TicWatch lineup has its devoted fans for a reason: super long battery life. The $249.99 TicWatch Pro 5 is no exception. It’s got an estimated 80 hours of battery life with standard use, a secondary ultra-low power display, and a massive (for a smartwatch you wear on your wrist, at least) 628mAh battery. I didn’t quite get 80 hours in my testing, but I did get a solid 48-60 hours with heavy GPS use. That outclasses most of the watches in this category (except the OnePluS Watch 2) and is useful for backpackers and endurance athletes. It might not hold a candle to a top-of-the-line Garmin, but it’s also a smarter watch for a fraction of the price.\nBattery life aside, the Pro 5 is a good option for fitness-focused people who aren’t keen on giving up smart capabilities for a Garmin or Polar. It’s also more durable. This time around, Mobvoi has also added a digital crown so you don’t have to worry about scrolling through menus with sweaty fingers. The flatter side button also reduces the risk of accidental presses.\nThe Pro 5 also has an ingenious method of displaying heart rate. When you lift up your arm, the backlight changes color depending on which heart rate zone you’re in. That means you can instantly gauge whether to up the intensity or slow your roll. The Pro 5 also adds new training metrics, like VO2 Max and recovery time.\nThe TicWatch supports stress tracking, all-day blood oxygen monitoring, fatigue assessments, as well as atrial fibrillation and irregular heartbeat detection. For outdoorsy types, it also has access to multiple GNSS systems, and there’s a new barometer and compass app, as well as a one-tap measurement app that gives you a quick look at five metrics (heart rate, blood oxygen, stress, respiratory rate, and overall heart health).\nIt’s also pretty capable on the productivity front. You get contactless payments, access to the Play Store, notifications, and the ability to take calls. It’s also the only Android smartwatch available in the US with the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Plus chip, which is a plus in terms of futureproofing. The only major concerns are the 50mm case that may not suit smaller wrists and the lack of a digital assistant.\nAnd good news! Mobvoi announced the rollout of Wear OS 4 in September, meaning all Pro 5 devices should be running the newer operating system at this point.\nRead my full Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 review.\nBest hybrid smartwatch\nSizes: 37mm with 18mm straps / Weight: 45g / Battery life: Up to 39 days / Display type: OLED display / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nHybrid smartwatches are an excellent way to keep things simple and subtle. The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light gets you the basics like push notifications, timers, and alarms. On the health front, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS workouts. (That said, GPS is tethered from your phone, not built in.) The design reminds me of a classier Swatch, particularly if you get the more colorful options in a minty green or pale blue. But the big reason the Light has dethroned our previous pick, the Garmin Vivomove Sport, is its extra-long battery life. Withings estimates it lasts up to 30 days on a single charge, and I got pretty close to that in testing with 25 days. Despite the Vivomove’s more appealing $180 price tag, it only lasts about five days.\nIf you want a bit more out of a hybrid, you can also opt for the ScanWatch 2. It’s an extra $100, but you get EKGs and atrial fibrillation detection, temperature sensors, SpO2 readings, and an altimeter for measuring elevation. It also looks a bit more elegant on the wrist, partly because of a secondary dial that tracks your daily step progress.\nIf neither matches your style, the Vivomove Sport is still a good option that gets you access to Garmin’s in-depth platform. Its Vivomove Trend is a slightly more upscale option that also supports Qi charging.\nRead my full Withings ScanWatch Light review.\nBest platform-agnostic fitness smartwatch\nSizes: 41mm with 18mm straps; 45mm with 22mm straps / Weight: 40g for the 3S; 47g for the 3 / Battery life: Up to 10 days for 3S; 14 days for 3 / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\nGarmin is best known for making rugged GPS watches that have excellent fitness features but aren’t so smart otherwise. But the $449.99 Venu 3 caters to people who want top-notch fitness tracking without sacrificing productivity features.\nIt’s got a colorful and vibrant always-on OLED display and comes in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm. Like its predecessor, the Venu 2 Plus, it also has a microphone and speaker so you can take and make calls directly from the wrist. It also has a clever workaround for digital assistants — it uses Bluetooth to work with whatever assistant is already on your phone. You’d think more fitness trackers would do this, but they don’t. It worked well in testing, though digital assistants aren’t always the smartest at understanding commands.\nThe Venu 3 doesn’t have the best third-party app ecosystem, but it has Spotify, Deezer, and Amazon Music for offline playback. Android users can also send quick responses for texts, and the watch works with either iOS or Android for folks who want to keep their options open. It also has fall detection, live tracking, and contactless payments.\nAs for health features, it has Garmin’s latest heart rate sensor, which enables its FDA-cleared EKG app to detect atrial fibrillation. Otherwise, you get built-in GPS, continuous heart rate monitoring, all of the advanced coaching features in the Garmin Connect app, and Garmin’s famous in-depth health data. The Venu 3 also improves sleep tracking with nap detection and adds audio-guided meditation sessions. There’s also a new wheelchair mode.\nThis isn’t the most hardcore Garmin that money can buy, but it’s definitely the smartest. The price is a bit high compared to most smartwatches, but by Garmin standards, it’s middle-of-the-pack.\nRead my full Garmin Venu 3S review.\nBest budget Android smartwatch\nSize: 43mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 29.5g for standard, 31.7g for premium / Battery life: Up to 10 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: Five GNSS systems / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nAmazfit’s made a name for itself making budget wearables that punch far above their weight. The $99.99 Amazfit Active 2 is no exception. \nThe Active 2 is a surprisingly spiffy watch considering its price. The standard version has a stainless steel case with tempered glass, and if you shell out $30 extra, you can get the premium model with sapphire crystal and an extra leather strap. Normally I don’t get compliments while wearing budget smartwatches, but I got several while wearing this one. \nWhile it doesn’t run Wear OS, its proprietary Zepp OS makes for a platform-agnostic smartwatch. Feature-wise, you get all the basics and then some. That includes things like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. You also get offline maps with turn-by-turn navigation, 160 different sport activity profiles, and a new strength training activity that automatically tracks reps. The Active 2 doesn’t have dual-frequency GPS, but it has the next best thing: access to all five of the major GNSS satellite systems. As far as health tracking goes, it also emphasizes trendy metrics like a readiness score and has a revamped sleep tracking algorithm. Battery life is estimated at about 10 days, though as a heavy user, I got around eight to nine in my testing. \nSomething that sets the Active 2 apart at this price range is access to an AI assistant on wrist and AI chatbots within the Zepp app. The Zepp Flow assistant (on wrist) is a little finicky, but you can use it to control your watch’s on-device settings and basic queries like asking for the weather. The Zepp Aura AI bot costs an extra $77 yearly, and you can ask it to deliver insights into your readiness and sleep scores. I found it hit or miss, but at least it’s well-integrated into the app, snappy, and most importantly, optional. More useful is the Zepp Coach, which you can use to generate custom training plans.\nAll in all, I don’t have much to gripe about this watch, which is wild given how affordable it is. It certainly delivers an outsized bang for your buck. Just make sure you wipe off any sweaty fingers, since its touchscreen doesn’t handle them well.\nRead my full Amazfit Active 2 review.\nHow we test smartwatches\nSmartwatches are meant to help you keep track of your notifications, as well as your health and activity. We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy. It also means evaluating how easy they are to pair, how annoying are notifications, and in the case of Android watches, checking to see if features are universally available across different phone makers (i.e., do all the Galaxy Watch features work if you have a Pixel phone?) Some factors we consider in our rankings are durability, performance, accuracy versus consistency in metrics, and of course, battery life.\nUpdate, March 4th: Adjusted pricing/availability and added pros/cons to several watches.","summary":"After a long stretch of slim pickings, the last couple of years have been huge for Android smartwatches.

Smartwatches are definitely getting more high-tech, but the Active 2 keeps the spirit of a humble fitness tracker — a good price, all the basic health features with a holistic tracking approach, and a comfy yet stylish design. At $99.99 for the standard version, and $129.99 for the premium version, you get an incredible amount of bang for your buck. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The hardware and design are surprisingly chic for the price. The standard version has a stainless steel case and tempered glass screen, while the premium version bumps you up to sapphire crystal and gets you an extra leather strap. The screen itself is nice and bright at 2,000 nits and you get an estimated 10 days of regular use on a single charge. (In testing, I got closer to eight to nine days as a power-user.) European users also get NFC payments. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257523_Amazfit_Active_2_AKrales_0080.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;I almost never get compliments on budget trackers.

It’s also got a daily readiness score and detailed sleep tracking if you’re into recovery metrics. (There’s also a Zepp Aura AI chatbot if you ever want to get more in-depth insights into your recovery metrics; It costs an extra $77 yearly but it’s also totally optional.) For workouts, it supports 160 different sport types, including HYROX and a new strength training mode that automatically counts reps. The Active 2 also adds offline maps, turn-by-turn directions, the ability to connect to third-party peripherals, and Zepp Coach — an AI-powered coach that can generate custom training plans for you. Built-in GPS with five satellite systems is also included.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t have a lot to complain about. My biggest gripes are the touch screen is hard to use with sweaty fingers and the onboard AI assistant for voice commands sometimes requires you to enunciate. You do lack advanced health features, like EKGs or sleep apnea detection, but that’s not really the point of something like the Active 2. This is meant to be a classic, basic fitness tracker that happens to look like a watch — and it does that with aplomb. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"iQzNNC\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smartwatch-review/608342/amazfit-active-2-review-budget-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracker\">Read my full review of the Amazfit Active 2 here</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oekq80\">Best fitness watch for casual users</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;40mm w/ 20mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;38g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 11 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;All-systems GNSS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Ant Plus /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;4GB (for Music Edition)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $250 Garmin Venu Sq 2 is the watch I recommend for anyone looking to replace their aging <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855458/fitbit-versa-2-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-price-specs-features\">Fitbit Versa 2</a>, 3,<strong> </strong>or 4. It’s got a similar look and vibe, with a much nicer OLED display and longer battery life.</p>\n\n<p>Garmin is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking, and that’s not an exception here. Of course, you get the basics, like steps and calories burned, but you get a whole lot more, too. There’s built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as plenty of other sports profiles like yoga and strength training. For smart features, you get push notifications, timers, contactless payments, and a bunch of safety features like Garmin’s Incident Detection, which is its take on fall detection. (You will need to carry your phone with you, however, as this doesn’t have LTE.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24259063/226428_Garmin_Venu_Sq_2_AKrales_0049.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Garmin Venu Sq 2 showing bright clock face on woman’s wrist\" title=\"Garmin Venu Sq 2 showing bright clock face on woman’s wrist\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Garmin Venu Sq 2 has a bright, beautiful OLED display and long battery life.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>If you want the option of onboard music, you can shell out $50 extra for the Music Edition, which comes with enough storage for about 500 songs. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, as you’ll most likely have your phone on you since this isn’t a true standalone watch.</p>\n\n<p>What I like most about this watch, however, is it’s one that you can grow with. On top of recovery metrics and sleep tracking, it also has Garmin Coach — a built-in, <em>free</em> training program for beginner and intermediate-level runners hoping to tackle a 5K, 10K, or half marathon. For health tracking, you can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, intensity minutes (how many minutes of moderate exercise you get per week), stress, hydration, respiratory rate, and menstrual cycles. And the best part is Garmin doesn’t lock any of this behind a paywall.</p>\n\n<p>One note: there is a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23982519/garmin-venu-3s-review-smartwatch-sleep-tracking-wearable\">Venu 3</a>, which adds a newer heart rate sensor and nap detection. I liked it quite a bit, and it ticks off a lot of the right boxes — except for price. It’s $450, which puts it outside what I’d consider ideal for casual users. The other option is Garmin’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24107020/garmin-forerunner-165-music-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Forerunner 165</a> — it’s a $249 budget training watch that’s quite similar to the Venu Sq 2 feature-wise, albeit with a sportier vibe. Basically, go with what you find on sale. I firmly believe older models are still a good choice if all you want is the fitness-tracking basics. This is especially true since newer software updates often make their way to older Garmins. Garmin users also tend to hang onto their devices for a good while. Strava’s 2023 year-end survey found that the most popular smartwatch among its users <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24024332/strava-users-are-still-hangin-onto-their-old-garmins\">was an eight-year-old Garmin</a>!</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1cZJF6\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23500640/garmin-venu-sq-2-review-smartwatch-fitness-tracker\">Read my full review of the Garmin Venu Sq 2</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"GnB1mV\">Best for serious outdoor athletes</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;7S Pro: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 7: 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 7X: 51mm w/ 26mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;7S Pro: 63g (Solar), 58g or 65g (Sapphire Solar, titanium or stainless steel); 7: 79g (Solar), 73g (Sapphire Solar); 7X: 96g (Solar), 89g (Sapphire Solar) /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong> 7S: up to 11 days, 14 w/ Solar; 7: up to 18 days, 22 days w/ solar; 7X: up to 28 days, 37 w/ solar /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;MIP touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;10ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Garmin’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22937154/garmin-fenix-7s-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch\">flagship Fenix 7 series</a> is no joke, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup takes it up a notch. It’s got built-in multiband GPS, solar charging on all models, the option of touchscreen or button navigation, topographical maps, and oodles upon oodles of data. Plus, every Fenix 7 Pro model has a hands-free LED flashlight, an upgraded heart rate sensor, and an improved memory-in-pixel display that’s slightly easier to read in low lighting.</p>\n\n<p>Garmin wearables are also known for providing extensive in-depth metrics, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup<strong> </strong>is no exception. You get excellent recovery metrics as well as helpful training guides and coaching programs. The best part is that Garmin doesn’t charge extra for those features. That’s good news, as these are expensive watches.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate how quickly these Fenix 7 watches can pick up a GPS signal. That’s a must if you’re training in the dead of winter. These watches can also take a beating. All models are built to military-grade standards and feature up to 10ATM of water resistance. That means they’re more than capable of a dunk in the ocean.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24806204/236729_Garmin_Fenix_7S_Pro_AKrales_0175.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A straight-on look at the Fenix 7S Pro’s flashlight at maximum brightness\" title=\"A straight-on look at the Fenix 7S Pro’s flashlight at maximum brightness\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The hands-free flashlight rules!&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Although the screen is brighter, <a href=\"https://os.mbed.com/teams/JapanDisplayInc/wiki/MIP-reflective-color-display\">MIP displays</a> still aren’t my absolute favorite — the OLED on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22934516/garmin-epix-2-review\">Garmin Epix 2</a> and the Epix Pro<strong> </strong>are much easier on the eyes. It’s admittedly tough to pick between the Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, Epix 2, and Epix Pro lineups — especially now that the Epix Pro also has great battery life, the LED flashlight, and now comes in multiple sizes. What it boils down to is whether you prioritize a brighter display, longer battery life, or price.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I prefer the Epix Pro for better readability, but the Fenix 7 Pro is the better choice if this is your first introduction to Garmin’s platform. You’ll get better battery life, the same LED flashlight, all the same training features, and a lower starting price. (You can also check out our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23691498/best-garmin-smartwatch-fitness-tracker-wearables\">Garmin buying guide</a> if you’d like even more alternatives.)</p>\n\n<p>Technically, there’s a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24228712/garmin-fenix-8-enduro-3-smartwatch-wearables\">new Fenix 8 series</a> on the block. That said, I still think the standard Fenix 7 or 7 Pro lineup is the better overall value. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24266434/garmin-fenix-8-review-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracking\">Fenix 8</a> adds diving features and voice assistant capabilities, but it also ups the standard Fenix 7’s starting price of $650 by an additional $350. That’s tough to swallow, especially since retailers may offer discounts on older models to get rid of existing inventory.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pocjm2\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23809801/garmin-fenix-7s-pro-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full review of the Garmin Fenix 7S Pro</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Tldrb0\">Best non-wrist tracker</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;12 proprietary sizes, 4–15, sizing kit needed /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;4–6g (depends on size) /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to seven days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;None /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;None /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 328 feet /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;None</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of fitness trackers are worn on the wrist, but the $349 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">Oura Ring</a> isn’t. The smart ring is a good option for people who are looking for something a little more discreet. It’s also less distracting than some other wrist-based options, as it lacks a screen and doesn’t mirror push notifications from your phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The new Oura Ring 4 isn’t functionally that much different from the previous Gen 3. It’s slimmer, features a new all-titanium design, has improved battery life, and has a new sensor algorithm that Oura says is more accurate. None of the new software features are gatekept to the Ring 4, so Gen 3 owners shouldn’t feel the need to upgrade unless their ring no longer lasts more than two days on a single charge. That said, the fourth-gen ring has an expanded size range spanning from 4 to 15. If you felt your Gen 3 was a bit snug or couldn’t find a size that fit right, you may have a better option now.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25665134/247314_Oura_Ring_4_AKrales_0022.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close up of Oura Ring 4 \" title=\"Close up of Oura Ring 4 \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Oura Ring 4 has an expanded size range, spanning sizes 4 to 15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>While smaller than your average wearable, the Oura Ring still tracks a ton of metrics, including heart rate variability, body temperature, blood oxygen, all-day heart rate monitoring, and cycle tracking. Since launching, the Oura Ring has also added activity tracking, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23278819/oura-ring-gen-3-spo2-blood-oxygen\">blood oxygen levels</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640205/oura-ring-sleep-tracking-chronotype-circadian-rhythm\">chronotypes</a> to help visualize your circadian rhythms, a social feature called <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23752876/oura-ring-social-circles-sleep-stage-algorithm\">Circles</a>, improved stress tracking, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24152827/oura-ring-cardiovascular-age-vo2-max-wearables\">cardiovascular age and capacity metrics</a>, and even an AI chatbot (in beta). It’s also rolled out a new <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/developing-ouras-latest-sleep-staging-algorithm/\">sleep stages algorithm</a> that it claims is more accurate than before. The app has also been entirely revamped to better organize all these new features and metrics.</p>\n\n<p>The Oura Ring tracks typical metrics — such as steps and calories burned —&nbsp; but its main focus is sleep and recovery. Each day, you’re given three sets of scores for your readiness, sleep, and activity. It’s a simple, holistic look at your overall wellness and an ideal pick if you want a more hands-off experience with your data.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Watch, you may want to consider the $399.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables\">Galaxy Ring</a>. It’s a bit more expensive than the base Oura Ring, but it doesn’t come with a subscription, and you get much better battery life when used with the Galaxy Watch. The hardware is also excellent, especially the charging case. That said, this is only an option for Android users, and even then, you don’t unlock its full potential unless you’ve got other Samsung gear. I also recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ULTRAHUMAN-AIR-Smart-Health-Tracker-Fitness/dp/B0D983R3N3\">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> for folks who don’t like the idea of Oura’s monthly subscription.</p>\n\n<p>You can read my experiences with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259284/oura-ring-samsung-galaxy-ring-ultrahuman-ring-air-ringconn-circular-ring-evie-ring-review-wearables\">a bunch of other smart rings</a>, but right now, the Oura Ring is the most polished with the best overall experience.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vRevUH\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">Read my full review of the Oura Ring 4</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"uc1OzU\">Best fitness band</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;42mm x 24mm x 12.2mm with 16mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;28g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 18 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Tethered /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;None</em></em></p>\n\n<p>It’s truly hard to beat the Amazfit Band 7’s $49.99 price — doubly so since you can often find it on sale for even less. Wearing the Band 7 feels like a throwback to 2014, which is great if all you’re looking for is a simple and casual tracker that won’t break the bank.</p>\n\n<p>No one is going to compliment you on the Band 7’s design, but it’s got a handful of cute watch faces that make good use of its OLED touchscreen. And despite having an OLED display, you’ll still get roughly 14 days of battery life on a single charge. It’s also incredibly lightweight, making it a good option for sleep tracking as well.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24477148/236555_Amazfit_Band_7_AKrales_0088.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Amazfit Band 7 with colorful clock face worn on woman’s wrist.\" title=\"Amazfit Band 7 with colorful clock face worn on woman’s wrist.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Amazfit Band 7 won’t turn heads, but it’s the type of capable yet affordable fitness band that’s much harder to find nowadays.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>You also get an absurd number of features for the price. That includes Amazon Alexa, continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, stress tracking, advanced sleep tracking, training metrics like VO2 max and load, abnormal heart rate alerts, menstrual tracking, push notifications, find my phone, a camera remote, and even a Pomodoro timer. You’re sacrificing contactless payments and will have to settle for tethered GPS, but this is a fair tradeoff considering everything else you’re getting. It’s not the best option for hardcore fitness tracking, but this is a great option if all you’re looking to do is casually track activity and your steps.</p>\n\n<p>Amazfit’s been making surprisingly good budget trackers for a while. That said, if you’re a little wary of a lesser-known brand, the $159.95 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23958997/fitbit-charge-6-review-fitness-tracker-side-button\">Fitbit Charge 6</a> is a decent alternative. It’s pricier, but you get a lot of what Amazfit is missing. That includes Google services like YouTube Music, Google Wallet, and Google Maps. Plus, it has built-in GPS and the ability to broadcast your heart rate with some Bluetooth-compatible gym equipment.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"WDJw0V\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23652417/amazfit-band-7-review-budget-fitness-tracker\">Read my full review of the Amazfit Band 7</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"QxUXWf\">Most stylish fitness watch</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;37mm with 18mm straps  /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;45g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 39 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp; OLED display /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Tethered GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light is a fetching hybrid analog smartwatch. Think of it as a dressier fitness band with some Swatch-like design sensibilities. It’s got all your basics like simple push notifications, timers, and alarms. Plus, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS activities straight from the wrist. It looks spiffy on the wrist, and if you like a pop of color, Withings offers minty green and pale blue color options. It’s also got excellent battery life, with an estimated 30 days on a single charge. I got a little less in testing at around 25 days, but that’s still much better than the vast majority of flagship smartwatches. This also looks way more stylish than beefier multisport watches with similar battery life.</p>\n\n<p>As its name suggests, the Light is a pared-down version of the $349.95 ScanWatch 2. The main things you’re missing are an EKG sensor for atrial fibrillation detection, a temperature sensor, blood oxygen tracking, and an altimeter for tracking elevation. For basic fitness tracking, you don’t really need those sensors. That’s why I think the extra $100 in savings is worth it for the Light, especially since both are lacking in safety features, contactless payments, and some other bells and whistles you can get from other watches in the $350 price range. That said, if you want extras, the ScanWatch 2 also gets you a slightly more elegant look thanks to the second step-counter dial.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25282433/247014_Withings_ScanWatch_2_Light_AKrales_0059.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close up of Withings ScanWatch 2\" title=\"Close up of Withings ScanWatch 2\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch 2 is about $100 more but adds more advanced health tracking.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Another option I like is the $179.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22882401/garmin-vivomove-sport-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-wearables\">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a>, which actually dominated this category in the past few years. It’s hard to beat the price, especially since it gets you access to Garmin’s platform. However, Garmin’s “hidden” OLED display can get washed out in bright lighting, and battery life was significantly shorter than other hybrid analog watches at around five days. Still, if you’d prefer a platform with a focus on fitness rather than wellness, the Vivomove Sport may be the better move over a Withings watch.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dB7TrL\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24085043/withings-scanwatch-2-scanwatch-light-review-wearables-smartwatch\">Read my full review of the Withings ScanWatch 2 and Light</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xIBcrh\">Best fitness tracker for iPhone users</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;42mm, 46mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;29.3g (42mm), 35.3g (46mm) /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 18 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;Always-on LTPO OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS: </strong>Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 50 meters /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a smartwatch that does fitness well, then iPhone owners need to look no further than the $399 Apple Watch Series 10. (The LTE version costs $50 more.) This is another iterative update, but the Series 10 is a much more comfortable watch than previous models. It’s thinner and lighter, plus there’s a larger display. If you’ve got a Series 5 or older, now is a good time to upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>With watchOS 11, there’s a new suite of training features. There’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/15/24195983/watchos-11-preview-training-load-vitals-fitness\">Training Load</a>, which gives you greater insight into how intensely you’ve been working out the past week compared to the last 28 days. There’s also a new Vitals app that flags when key metrics, like sleep duration or heart rate, may be out of whack. Plus, you can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24175506/apple-watch-watchos-11-rest-days-wearables\">finally pause your rings</a> for rest days. The software update also brings some savvy updates to the Smart Stack. For example, if you’re in a noisy cafe wondering what song’s playing, the Smart Stack can now surface the Shazaam widget. It also now supports Live Activities, turning your wrist into a mini Dynamic Island. Health-wise, we also now have FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, we also have to address <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute\">the Apple Watch ban</a>. As of January 18th, 2024, new Apple Watches sold in the US have the blood oxygen feature disabled due to an ongoing patent battle with medical device maker Masimo. This isn’t a huge deal for most people, as this feature isn’t that useful for most people yet, and the new sleep apnea feature exclusively uses the accelerometer rather than the blood oxygen sensor. You might want to consider a refurbished Series 7 or 8 if blood oxygen sensing is important to you, however.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a first-time buyer, you can also opt for the second-gen <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">Apple Watch SE</a>. It’s slightly cheaper at $249, and while you don’t get as many features, it’s a good introduction to the ecosystem. Otherwise, if you’re the type of athlete who covets a Garmin, you may also want to consider splurging on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. It’s more expensive at $799, but it does have the brightest screen of any Apple Watch, comes with dual-frequency GPS, has diving and hiking safety features, and is made of more durable materials. There’s also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables\">a fetching new black color</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ic9D8k\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full review of the Apple Watch Series 10</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"AsVbve\">Best fitness smartwatch for Samsung phones</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;47mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;60.5g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 100 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type: </strong>Always-on OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS: </strong>Built-in GPS&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;10ATM, IP68 /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Truthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra left me a bit disappointed after reviewing it — not because it’s a bad piece of hardware, but because it copies a bit too much from Apple. Even so, this is the most full-featured fitness smartwatch a Samsung phone owner can buy.</p>\n\n<p>While I prefer the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch 7 </a>myself, I can’t say it’s the best for fitness tracking. There was too much of a gap between it and the Ultra in my testing as far as accuracy, especially for GPS tracking. But what really sealed the deal for me was the difference in battery life. It’s simply night and day, and the Galaxy Watch 7 really struggled in this arena. (The gaps are much less egregious between the base Apple Watch and Ultra 2.)</p>\n\n<p>The caveat is, if all you want is casual fitness tracking, the Galaxy Watch 7 is the better choice for wearability. It’s just more comfortable for sleep tracking and lighter overall. Just keep in mind it lacks the Ultra’s emergency siren and shortcut button, and the screen doesn’t get quite as bright.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25554228/gwultra_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close-up of Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on shoes\" title=\"Close-up of Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on shoes\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It’s not the prettiest Samsung watch, but it is the best at fitness tracking.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\" />\n<p>With both watches, you get a faster processor, a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, some AI health features, and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The newer hardware makes for a more futureproof purchase, but I found the AI health features to be hit-or-miss in practice. As always, some features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, are limited to Samsung owners. That makes this hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to non-Samsung Android users.</p>\n\n<p>But if the Ultra doesn’t float your boat, now is a good time to find the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23818557/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review-bezels-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch 6 series</a>, particularly the base models, on sale. The base Galaxy Watch 7 may have newer hardware, but as far as actual use goes, it’s not a massive update over the Watch 6. And if you’re into a physical rotating bezel, just go ahead and snag a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"AbaYyl\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"J4WTr1\">Best fitness smartwatch for Android</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;41mm, 45mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;31g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 24 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type: </strong>Always-on OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS: </strong>Built-in GPS&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>With the Pixel Watch 3, Google is finally done playing catch-up.</p>\n\n<p>There are truly too many updates to call each one out individually, but overall, they fall into two buckets: refinement and expansion. The hardware is mostly the same as the Pixel Watch 2 in terms of design. However, we now have a brighter screen, smaller bezels, and a new 45mm size. The larger size is quite nice, especially if you prefer larger screens without sacrificing wearability.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life is also better. There’s a new battery-saver mode that kicks in when you hit 15 percent, and the new displays are also more power efficient. Plus, bedtime mode is automatic now, so that helps the watch last longer overnight for sleep tracking. It’s only a modest improvement over the Pixel Watch 2, but it’s dramatic compared to the original.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25610300/247234_Pixel_Watch_3_AKrales_0303.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Person tying shoes while wearing both sizes of the Pixel Watch 3\" title=\"Person tying shoes while wearing both sizes of the Pixel Watch 3\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Watch now comes in two sizes: 41mm (right) and 45mm (left).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Software is where the Pixel Watch 3 makes the most updates. There are a ton of new fitness and health features, including a new running dashboard, custom running workouts, and AI-generated workout suggestions. There’s also a revamped Daily Readiness Score and a new Cardio Load metric, which gauges how intensely you’ve been exercising. For European users, you can also get the new Loss of Pulse feature, which calls emergency services on your behalf if it detects you no longer have a pulse. Unfortunately, this isn’t available stateside, as it hasn’t yet received FDA clearance.</p>\n\n<p>The Pixel Watch 3 also better integrates with Google services and the Pixel ecosystem. You can now view your Nest Doorbell or Camera feed straight from the wrist — and it’s quite handy if you get a lot of packages or guests. If you have Google TV, you can use the watch as a remote. Now that the watch has an ultra wideband chip, it can also now unlock your Pixel phone. You can also use the Recorder app to capture audio and send it straight to your Pixel phone.</p>\n\n<p>That said, some of these features now mean the Pixel Watch works best with a Pixel phone. If you’re looking for alternatives to Google and Samsung, the $299.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables\">OnePlus Watch 2</a> is a strong alternative.

If strength training is your main form of exercise, you’re better off looking elsewhere. Like the Oura Ring, this is a distraction-free tracker that specializes in sleep and recovery. The main difference is this has a more athletic bent. For instance, you’ll get way more insight into how much strain you’ve taken on in the past week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Whoop also provides <a href=\"https://shop.whoop.com/en-us/collections/whoopbody/?order_by=featured\">a lot of novel ways to wear its tracker</a>, including in underwear and arm/knee sleeves.

We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy.

Modern trackers can monitor everything from your heart health to how well you’ve recovered from a hard bout of training. Even flagship smartwatches, which used to be lackluster trackers, have become pretty adept workout companions. Whatever your fitness goals are, there’s probably a fitness tracker that can help you achieve them.\nCompared to some other gadgets, wearables are incredibly personal, which means there are a few extra considerations you’ll have to take into account before reaching for your wallet. It makes it hard to say that any one fitness tracker is the best for everyone. Thankfully, the best thing about fitness trackers in 2025 is that there’s enough variety to fit into every kind of lifestyle. \n\n\nAudience\nWho is this fitness tracker for? The ideal fitness tracker for hardcore athletes will look different than the best one for casual users looking to get a few more steps in.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life\nA fitness tracker should be able to go at least two to three days between charges. If it’s a flagship smartwatch, it should at least offer quick charging.\n\n\n\n\n\nForm factor\nIs it a band or a smartwatch? Is it comfortable to wear 24/7?\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrics\nWhat metrics does this device track? We prioritize active minutes over steps and calorie burn, but health metrics like resting heart rate, VO2 Max, and sleep quality are plusses.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency\nAccuracy is nice, but it’s more important for measuring progress that your device delivers consistent results for heart rate, distance tracking, and steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCertain trackers are limited to specific phone ecosystems — others will work regardless of what your phone is. We prioritize the latter wherever possible.\n\n\nBest fitness tracker overall\nSize: 43mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 29.5g for standard, 31.7g for premium / Battery life: Up to 10 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: Five GNSS systems / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nHear us out: the Amazfit Active 2 is the new all-rounder on the block. Smartwatches are definitely getting more high-tech, but the Active 2 keeps the spirit of a humble fitness tracker — a good price, all the basic health features with a holistic tracking approach, and a comfy yet stylish design. At $99.99 for the standard version, and $129.99 for the premium version, you get an incredible amount of bang for your buck. \nThe hardware and design are surprisingly chic for the price. The standard version has a stainless steel case and tempered glass screen, while the premium version bumps you up to sapphire crystal and gets you an extra leather strap. The screen itself is nice and bright at 2,000 nits and you get an estimated 10 days of regular use on a single charge. (In testing, I got closer to eight to nine days as a power-user.) European users also get NFC payments. \nAs far as health features go, you get all the basics like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. It’s also got a daily readiness score and detailed sleep tracking if you’re into recovery metrics. (There’s also a Zepp Aura AI chatbot if you ever want to get more in-depth insights into your recovery metrics; It costs an extra $77 yearly but it’s also totally optional.) For workouts, it supports 160 different sport types, including HYROX and a new strength training mode that automatically counts reps. The Active 2 also adds offline maps, turn-by-turn directions, the ability to connect to third-party peripherals, and Zepp Coach — an AI-powered coach that can generate custom training plans for you. Built-in GPS with five satellite systems is also included.\nI don’t have a lot to complain about. My biggest gripes are the touch screen is hard to use with sweaty fingers and the onboard AI assistant for voice commands sometimes requires you to enunciate. You do lack advanced health features, like EKGs or sleep apnea detection, but that’s not really the point of something like the Active 2. This is meant to be a classic, basic fitness tracker that happens to look like a watch — and it does that with aplomb. \nRead my full review of the Amazfit Active 2 here.\nBest fitness watch for casual users\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)\nThe $250 Garmin Venu Sq 2 is the watch I recommend for anyone looking to replace their aging Fitbit Versa 2, 3, or 4. It’s got a similar look and vibe, with a much nicer OLED display and longer battery life.\nGarmin is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking, and that’s not an exception here. Of course, you get the basics, like steps and calories burned, but you get a whole lot more, too. There’s built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as plenty of other sports profiles like yoga and strength training. For smart features, you get push notifications, timers, contactless payments, and a bunch of safety features like Garmin’s Incident Detection, which is its take on fall detection. (You will need to carry your phone with you, however, as this doesn’t have LTE.)\nIf you want the option of onboard music, you can shell out $50 extra for the Music Edition, which comes with enough storage for about 500 songs. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, as you’ll most likely have your phone on you since this isn’t a true standalone watch.\nWhat I like most about this watch, however, is it’s one that you can grow with. On top of recovery metrics and sleep tracking, it also has Garmin Coach — a built-in, free training program for beginner and intermediate-level runners hoping to tackle a 5K, 10K, or half marathon. For health tracking, you can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, intensity minutes (how many minutes of moderate exercise you get per week), stress, hydration, respiratory rate, and menstrual cycles. And the best part is Garmin doesn’t lock any of this behind a paywall.\nOne note: there is a Venu 3, which adds a newer heart rate sensor and nap detection. I liked it quite a bit, and it ticks off a lot of the right boxes — except for price. It’s $450, which puts it outside what I’d consider ideal for casual users. The other option is Garmin’s Forerunner 165 — it’s a $249 budget training watch that’s quite similar to the Venu Sq 2 feature-wise, albeit with a sportier vibe. Basically, go with what you find on sale. I firmly believe older models are still a good choice if all you want is the fitness-tracking basics. This is especially true since newer software updates often make their way to older Garmins. Garmin users also tend to hang onto their devices for a good while. Strava’s 2023 year-end survey found that the most popular smartwatch among its users was an eight-year-old Garmin!\nRead my full review of the Garmin Venu Sq 2.\nBest for serious outdoor athletes\nSizes: 7S Pro: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 7: 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 7X: 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 7S Pro: 63g (Solar), 58g or 65g (Sapphire Solar, titanium or stainless steel); 7: 79g (Solar), 73g (Sapphire Solar); 7X: 96g (Solar), 89g (Sapphire Solar) / Battery life: 7S: up to 11 days, 14 w/ Solar; 7: up to 18 days, 22 days w/ solar; 7X: up to 28 days, 37 w/ solar / Display type: MIP touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GB\nGarmin’s flagship Fenix 7 series is no joke, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup takes it up a notch. It’s got built-in multiband GPS, solar charging on all models, the option of touchscreen or button navigation, topographical maps, and oodles upon oodles of data. Plus, every Fenix 7 Pro model has a hands-free LED flashlight, an upgraded heart rate sensor, and an improved memory-in-pixel display that’s slightly easier to read in low lighting.\nGarmin wearables are also known for providing extensive in-depth metrics, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup is no exception. You get excellent recovery metrics as well as helpful training guides and coaching programs. The best part is that Garmin doesn’t charge extra for those features. That’s good news, as these are expensive watches.\nI appreciate how quickly these Fenix 7 watches can pick up a GPS signal. That’s a must if you’re training in the dead of winter. These watches can also take a beating. All models are built to military-grade standards and feature up to 10ATM of water resistance. That means they’re more than capable of a dunk in the ocean.\nAlthough the screen is brighter, MIP displays still aren’t my absolute favorite — the OLED on the Garmin Epix 2 and the Epix Pro are much easier on the eyes. It’s admittedly tough to pick between the Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, Epix 2, and Epix Pro lineups — especially now that the Epix Pro also has great battery life, the LED flashlight, and now comes in multiple sizes. What it boils down to is whether you prioritize a brighter display, longer battery life, or price.\nPersonally, I prefer the Epix Pro for better readability, but the Fenix 7 Pro is the better choice if this is your first introduction to Garmin’s platform. You’ll get better battery life, the same LED flashlight, all the same training features, and a lower starting price. (You can also check out our Garmin buying guide if you’d like even more alternatives.)\nTechnically, there’s a new Fenix 8 series on the block. That said, I still think the standard Fenix 7 or 7 Pro lineup is the better overall value. The Fenix 8 adds diving features and voice assistant capabilities, but it also ups the standard Fenix 7’s starting price of $650 by an additional $350. That’s tough to swallow, especially since retailers may offer discounts on older models to get rid of existing inventory.\nRead my full review of the Garmin Fenix 7S Pro.\nBest non-wrist tracker\nSizes: 12 proprietary sizes, 4–15, sizing kit needed / Weight: 4–6g (depends on size) / Battery life: Up to seven days / Display type: None / GPS: None / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: Up to 328 feet / Music storage: None\nThe vast majority of fitness trackers are worn on the wrist, but the $349 Oura Ring isn’t. The smart ring is a good option for people who are looking for something a little more discreet. It’s also less distracting than some other wrist-based options, as it lacks a screen and doesn’t mirror push notifications from your phone. \nThe new Oura Ring 4 isn’t functionally that much different from the previous Gen 3. It’s slimmer, features a new all-titanium design, has improved battery life, and has a new sensor algorithm that Oura says is more accurate. None of the new software features are gatekept to the Ring 4, so Gen 3 owners shouldn’t feel the need to upgrade unless their ring no longer lasts more than two days on a single charge. That said, the fourth-gen ring has an expanded size range spanning from 4 to 15. If you felt your Gen 3 was a bit snug or couldn’t find a size that fit right, you may have a better option now.\nWhile smaller than your average wearable, the Oura Ring still tracks a ton of metrics, including heart rate variability, body temperature, blood oxygen, all-day heart rate monitoring, and cycle tracking. Since launching, the Oura Ring has also added activity tracking, blood oxygen levels, chronotypes to help visualize your circadian rhythms, a social feature called Circles, improved stress tracking, cardiovascular age and capacity metrics, and even an AI chatbot (in beta). It’s also rolled out a new sleep stages algorithm that it claims is more accurate than before. The app has also been entirely revamped to better organize all these new features and metrics.\nThe Oura Ring tracks typical metrics — such as steps and calories burned —  but its main focus is sleep and recovery. Each day, you’re given three sets of scores for your readiness, sleep, and activity. It’s a simple, holistic look at your overall wellness and an ideal pick if you want a more hands-off experience with your data.\nIf you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Watch, you may want to consider the $399.99 Galaxy Ring. It’s a bit more expensive than the base Oura Ring, but it doesn’t come with a subscription, and you get much better battery life when used with the Galaxy Watch. The hardware is also excellent, especially the charging case. That said, this is only an option for Android users, and even then, you don’t unlock its full potential unless you’ve got other Samsung gear. I also recommend the Ultrahuman Ring Air for folks who don’t like the idea of Oura’s monthly subscription.\nYou can read my experiences with a bunch of other smart rings, but right now, the Oura Ring is the most polished with the best overall experience.\nRead my full review of the Oura Ring 4.\nBest fitness band\nSize: 42mm x 24mm x 12.2mm with 16mm straps / Weight: 28g / Battery life: Up to 18 days / Display type: OLED / GPS: Tethered / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: None\nIt’s truly hard to beat the Amazfit Band 7’s $49.99 price — doubly so since you can often find it on sale for even less. Wearing the Band 7 feels like a throwback to 2014, which is great if all you’re looking for is a simple and casual tracker that won’t break the bank.\nNo one is going to compliment you on the Band 7’s design, but it’s got a handful of cute watch faces that make good use of its OLED touchscreen. And despite having an OLED display, you’ll still get roughly 14 days of battery life on a single charge. It’s also incredibly lightweight, making it a good option for sleep tracking as well.\nYou also get an absurd number of features for the price. That includes Amazon Alexa, continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, stress tracking, advanced sleep tracking, training metrics like VO2 max and load, abnormal heart rate alerts, menstrual tracking, push notifications, find my phone, a camera remote, and even a Pomodoro timer. You’re sacrificing contactless payments and will have to settle for tethered GPS, but this is a fair tradeoff considering everything else you’re getting. It’s not the best option for hardcore fitness tracking, but this is a great option if all you’re looking to do is casually track activity and your steps.\nAmazfit’s been making surprisingly good budget trackers for a while. That said, if you’re a little wary of a lesser-known brand, the $159.95 Fitbit Charge 6 is a decent alternative. It’s pricier, but you get a lot of what Amazfit is missing. That includes Google services like YouTube Music, Google Wallet, and Google Maps. Plus, it has built-in GPS and the ability to broadcast your heart rate with some Bluetooth-compatible gym equipment.\nRead my full review of the Amazfit Band 7.\nMost stylish fitness watch\nSizes: 37mm with 18mm straps  / Weight: 45g / Battery life: Up to 39 days / Display type:  OLED display / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nThe $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light is a fetching hybrid analog smartwatch. Think of it as a dressier fitness band with some Swatch-like design sensibilities. It’s got all your basics like simple push notifications, timers, and alarms. Plus, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS activities straight from the wrist. It looks spiffy on the wrist, and if you like a pop of color, Withings offers minty green and pale blue color options. It’s also got excellent battery life, with an estimated 30 days on a single charge. I got a little less in testing at around 25 days, but that’s still much better than the vast majority of flagship smartwatches. This also looks way more stylish than beefier multisport watches with similar battery life.\nAs its name suggests, the Light is a pared-down version of the $349.95 ScanWatch 2. The main things you’re missing are an EKG sensor for atrial fibrillation detection, a temperature sensor, blood oxygen tracking, and an altimeter for tracking elevation. For basic fitness tracking, you don’t really need those sensors. That’s why I think the extra $100 in savings is worth it for the Light, especially since both are lacking in safety features, contactless payments, and some other bells and whistles you can get from other watches in the $350 price range. That said, if you want extras, the ScanWatch 2 also gets you a slightly more elegant look thanks to the second step-counter dial.\nAnother option I like is the $179.99 Garmin Vivomove Sport, which actually dominated this category in the past few years. It’s hard to beat the price, especially since it gets you access to Garmin’s platform. However, Garmin’s “hidden” OLED display can get washed out in bright lighting, and battery life was significantly shorter than other hybrid analog watches at around five days. Still, if you’d prefer a platform with a focus on fitness rather than wellness, the Vivomove Sport may be the better move over a Withings watch.\nRead my full review of the Withings ScanWatch 2 and Light.\nBest fitness tracker for iPhone users\nSizes: 42mm, 46mm / Weight: 29.3g (42mm), 35.3g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 18 hours / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 32GB\nIf you’re looking for a smartwatch that does fitness well, then iPhone owners need to look no further than the $399 Apple Watch Series 10. (The LTE version costs $50 more.) This is another iterative update, but the Series 10 is a much more comfortable watch than previous models. It’s thinner and lighter, plus there’s a larger display. If you’ve got a Series 5 or older, now is a good time to upgrade.\nWith watchOS 11, there’s a new suite of training features. There’s Training Load, which gives you greater insight into how intensely you’ve been working out the past week compared to the last 28 days. There’s also a new Vitals app that flags when key metrics, like sleep duration or heart rate, may be out of whack. Plus, you can finally pause your rings for rest days. The software update also brings some savvy updates to the Smart Stack. For example, if you’re in a noisy cafe wondering what song’s playing, the Smart Stack can now surface the Shazaam widget. It also now supports Live Activities, turning your wrist into a mini Dynamic Island. Health-wise, we also now have FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection.\nOf course, we also have to address the Apple Watch ban. As of January 18th, 2024, new Apple Watches sold in the US have the blood oxygen feature disabled due to an ongoing patent battle with medical device maker Masimo. This isn’t a huge deal for most people, as this feature isn’t that useful for most people yet, and the new sleep apnea feature exclusively uses the accelerometer rather than the blood oxygen sensor. You might want to consider a refurbished Series 7 or 8 if blood oxygen sensing is important to you, however.\nIf you’re a first-time buyer, you can also opt for the second-gen Apple Watch SE. It’s slightly cheaper at $249, and while you don’t get as many features, it’s a good introduction to the ecosystem. Otherwise, if you’re the type of athlete who covets a Garmin, you may also want to consider splurging on the Apple Watch Ultra 2. It’s more expensive at $799, but it does have the brightest screen of any Apple Watch, comes with dual-frequency GPS, has diving and hiking safety features, and is made of more durable materials. There’s also a fetching new black color.\nRead my full review of the Apple Watch Series 10.\nBest fitness smartwatch for Samsung phones\nSizes: 47mm / Weight: 60.5g / Battery life: Up to 100 hours / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM, IP68 / Music storage: 32GB\nTruthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra left me a bit disappointed after reviewing it — not because it’s a bad piece of hardware, but because it copies a bit too much from Apple. Even so, this is the most full-featured fitness smartwatch a Samsung phone owner can buy.\nWhile I prefer the Galaxy Watch 7 myself, I can’t say it’s the best for fitness tracking. There was too much of a gap between it and the Ultra in my testing as far as accuracy, especially for GPS tracking. But what really sealed the deal for me was the difference in battery life. It’s simply night and day, and the Galaxy Watch 7 really struggled in this arena. (The gaps are much less egregious between the base Apple Watch and Ultra 2.)\nThe caveat is, if all you want is casual fitness tracking, the Galaxy Watch 7 is the better choice for wearability. It’s just more comfortable for sleep tracking and lighter overall. Just keep in mind it lacks the Ultra’s emergency siren and shortcut button, and the screen doesn’t get quite as bright.\nWith both watches, you get a faster processor, a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, some AI health features, and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The newer hardware makes for a more futureproof purchase, but I found the AI health features to be hit-or-miss in practice. As always, some features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, are limited to Samsung owners. That makes this hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to non-Samsung Android users.\nBut if the Ultra doesn’t float your boat, now is a good time to find the Galaxy Watch 6 series, particularly the base models, on sale. The base Galaxy Watch 7 may have newer hardware, but as far as actual use goes, it’s not a massive update over the Watch 6. And if you’re into a physical rotating bezel, just go ahead and snag a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.\nRead my full review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.\nBest fitness smartwatch for Android\nSizes: 41mm, 45mm / Weight: 31g / Battery life: Up to 24 hours / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nWith the Pixel Watch 3, Google is finally done playing catch-up.\nThere are truly too many updates to call each one out individually, but overall, they fall into two buckets: refinement and expansion. The hardware is mostly the same as the Pixel Watch 2 in terms of design. However, we now have a brighter screen, smaller bezels, and a new 45mm size. The larger size is quite nice, especially if you prefer larger screens without sacrificing wearability.\nBattery life is also better. There’s a new battery-saver mode that kicks in when you hit 15 percent, and the new displays are also more power efficient. Plus, bedtime mode is automatic now, so that helps the watch last longer overnight for sleep tracking. It’s only a modest improvement over the Pixel Watch 2, but it’s dramatic compared to the original.\nSoftware is where the Pixel Watch 3 makes the most updates. There are a ton of new fitness and health features, including a new running dashboard, custom running workouts, and AI-generated workout suggestions. There’s also a revamped Daily Readiness Score and a new Cardio Load metric, which gauges how intensely you’ve been exercising. For European users, you can also get the new Loss of Pulse feature, which calls emergency services on your behalf if it detects you no longer have a pulse. Unfortunately, this isn’t available stateside, as it hasn’t yet received FDA clearance.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 also better integrates with Google services and the Pixel ecosystem. You can now view your Nest Doorbell or Camera feed straight from the wrist — and it’s quite handy if you get a lot of packages or guests. If you have Google TV, you can use the watch as a remote. Now that the watch has an ultra wideband chip, it can also now unlock your Pixel phone. You can also use the Recorder app to capture audio and send it straight to your Pixel phone.\nThat said, some of these features now mean the Pixel Watch works best with a Pixel phone. If you’re looking for alternatives to Google and Samsung, the $299.99 OnePlus Watch 2 is a strong alternative. You’re giving up LTE, but it’s a handsome-looking watch with surprisingly long battery life and Google Assistant from the get-go.\nRead my full review of the Google Pixel Watch 3.\nBest for early adopters and elite athletes\nSizes: 43mm by 28mm by 10mm / Weight: 18g / Battery life: 4–5 days / Display type: None / GPS: None / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: Up to 10 meters / Music storage: None\nThe Whoop 4.0 is not for the casual enthusiast. Not only does it come with an expensive monthly subscription, but the information it provides is only useful if you’re actively training for a cardio-intensive sport. If strength training is your main form of exercise, you’re better off looking elsewhere. Like the Oura Ring, this is a distraction-free tracker that specializes in sleep and recovery. The main difference is this has a more athletic bent. For instance, you’ll get way more insight into how much strain you’ve taken on in the past week. \nWhoop also provides a lot of novel ways to wear its tracker, including in underwear and arm/knee sleeves. This makes it an appealing option if you’re one of those unicorns who needs a secondary tracker to supplement another form of fitness tracking. Again, this is a tracker best appreciated by people who go hard and aren’t afraid to experiment. Plus, Whoop recently lowered its subscription prices in certain tiers, so while it’s still expensive, it’s not quite as pricey as it used to be.\nRead my full review of the Whoop 4.0.\n\n\nWhat’s coming next:\nWe’re currently in the process of testing the $329.99 OnePlus Watch 3, which will arrive “sometime in April.” The forthcoming smartwatch — which was recently delayed as a result of a typo on its backplate —offers a proper rotating crown and a larger, brighter display than the OnePlus Watch 2. It also introduces new health features, including a wrist temperature sensor and OnePlus’ 60S Health Check-In, which gives you a quick scan of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, mental wellness, wrist temperature, sleep quality, and vascular age when you touch a side button.\nSamsung launched the $59.99 Galaxy Fit 3 in the US on January 9th. The budget-friendly fitness band, which we’re also in the process of testing, doesn’t come with built-in GPS like Samsung’s pricier Galaxy Watch 7, but it can monitor your sleep patterns and heart rate, check blood oxygen levels, detect snoring, and track more than 100 workout types. It also features a 1.6-inch AMOLED display and should last up to 13 days on a single charge.\nLastly, we’re also testing the $299 RingConn Gen 2. We weren’t super impressed with the original, but the second-gen model does have a few things going for it over the Oura Ring 4. It provides access to all your standard health-tracking features without a subscription, for one thing, and it features both an IP68 dust and water resistance rating and sleep apnea detection. The company also says it offers longer battery life, which is impressive given its predecessor lasted us up to nine days on a single charge.\nHow we test fitness trackers\nFitness trackers are meant to help you keep track of your health and activity. We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy. Some factors we consider in our rankings are durability, performance, accuracy versus consistency in metrics, and of course, battery life.]\nUpdate, March 4: Updated pricing and added a section about other trackers we’re testing.","summary":"Fitness trackers have come a long way from the simple bands that tracked steps and little else.
