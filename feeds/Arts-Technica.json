But the company's largest announcement, by volume, is about laptop processors.\nToday the company is expanding the Ryzen AI 300 lineup with a batch of updated high-end chips with up to 16 CPU cores and some midrange options for cheaper Copilot+ PCs. AMD has repackaged some of its high-end desktop chips for gaming laptops, including the first Ryzen laptop CPU with 3D V-Cache enabled. And there's also a new-in-name-only Ryzen 200 series, another repackaging of familiar silicon to address lower-budget laptops.\nRyzen AI 300 is back, along with high-end Max and Max+ versions\nWe came away largely impressed by the initial Ryzen AI 300 processors in August 2024, and new processors being announced today expand the lineup upward and downward.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Andrew Cunningham\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amds-2025-ryzen-laptop-lineup-a-mix-of-powerful-new-and-renamed-old/#comments","content":"\n            New Ryzen AI CPUs boost speeds, but cheaper laptops get another Ryzen rebrand.\n          ","contentSnippet":"New Ryzen AI CPUs boost speeds, but cheaper laptops get another Ryzen rebrand.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amds-2025-ryzen-laptop-lineup-a-mix-of-powerful-new-and-renamed-old/","categories":["Tech","AMD","CPUs","Ryzen","ryzen 200","ryzen 7000","ryzen 8000","ryzen ai","ryzen ai 300"],"isoDate":"2025-01-06T20:31:08.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Andrew Cunningham\n        ","title":"AMD launches new Ryzen 9000X3D CPUs for PCs that play games and work hard","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/amd-launches-new-ryzen-9000x3d-cpus-for-pcs-that-play-games-and-work-hard/","pubDate":"Mon, 06 Jan 2025 19:45:35 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>AMD's batch of CES announcements this year includes just two new products for desktop PC users: the new Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D.

The HDMI Forum announced at CES today that it's time to start considering new headaches. HDMI 2.2 will require new cables for full compatibility, but it has the same physical connectors. Tiny QR codes are suggested to help with that, however.\nThe new specification is named HDMI 2.2, but compatible cables will carry an \"Ultra96\" marker to indicate that they can carry 96GBps, double the 48 of HDMI 2.1b. The Forum anticipates this will result in higher resolutions and refresh rates and a \"next-gen HDMI Fixed Rate Link.\" The Forum cited \"AR/VR/MR, spatial reality, and light field displays\" as benefiting from increased bandwidth, along with medical imaging and machine vision.\n\n    \n\n    \nA bit closer to home, the HDMI 2.2 specification also includes \"Latency Indication Protocol\" (LIP), which can help improve audio and video synchronization. This should matter most in \"multi-hop\" systems, such as home theater setups with soundbars or receivers. Illustrations offered by the Forum show LIP working to correct delays on headphones, soundbars connected through ARC or eARC, and mixed systems where some components may be connected to a TV, while others go straight into the receiver.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kevin Purdy\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/hdmi-2-2-will-require-new-ultra96-cables-whenever-we-have-8k-tvs-and-content/#comments","content":"\n            The physical connector is, confusingly but expectedly, the same.\n          ","contentSnippet":"The physical connector is, confusingly but expectedly, the same.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/hdmi-2-2-will-require-new-ultra96-cables-whenever-we-have-8k-tvs-and-content/","categories":["Tech","HDMI","hdmi 2.2","ultra96"],"isoDate":"2025-01-06T17:27:07.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Benj Edwards\n        ","title":"Sam Altman says “we are now confident we know how to build AGI”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/01/sam-altman-says-we-are-now-confident-we-know-how-to-build-agi/","pubDate":"Mon, 06 Jan 2025 17:18:01 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>On Sunday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offered two eye-catching predictions about the near-future of artificial intelligence.
