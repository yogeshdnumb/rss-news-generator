It’s a long-awaited title from Bungie and revives the classic <em>Marathon </em>IP in the form of a PvPvE extraction shooter. After a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23735830/bungie-marathon-sci-fi-pvp-extraction-shooter\">teaser nearly two years ago</a>, the Sony-owned studio just spent an hour showing off <em>Marathon</em> gameplay and game mechanics and revealed the game will launch on September 23rd on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC, with full cross-play and cross-save. There’s even an alpha test for fans to try out the game later this month, ahead of its full debut this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Marathon </em>is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, in the remains of Tau Ceti IV, which Bungie describes as a lost colony whose inhabitants disappeared without a trace. Rival factions have hired Runners to scavenge for what’s left behind, and anyone who signs up to be a Runner has given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell with unique abilities and stats.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?rel=0&#038;start=1\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You can face rival runners in maps of up to 18 players, so up to six teams, in a bid to grab as much loot as possible and get out. While <em>Marathon </em>is designed to be played in crews, with contextual pings and shared objectives, you can also play solo instead of having to form a dedicated three-person team.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/2025_Marathon_Reveal_Press_Kit_LARGE_002.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;In &lt;/em&gt;Marathon&lt;em&gt;, you play as a Runner who has to loot the map and get out quick.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bungie\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Bungie\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In <em>Marathon</em> runs, there will be what Bungie calls security forces, PvE enemies that roam the world. There are also creatures on these planets that are a threat when you&#8217;re navigating toward points on a map. You&#8217;ll have to choose whether it&#8217;s worth engaging with these enemies and risk revealing your location to rival teams or use a strategy of avoiding these threats in this PvPvE environment.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The maps are filled with bold and vibrant artwork and weapons, materials, and equipment that can be scavenged. Before a run, you build a loadout and select the Runner that fits your play style. In the alpha test, which starts on April 23rd, there will be four runners to choose from, including the stealthy Void character that can go invisible much like a Hunter from <em>Destiny 2</em>. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/2025_Marathon_Reveal_Press_Kit_LARGE_001.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,3.4613147178592,100,93.077370564282\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;There are a variety of runners to pick from with different abilities and play styles.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bungie\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Bungie\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There&#8217;s also a Glitch runner that has fast-paced abilities and, like its name implies, can glitch out enemies. If you&#8217;re more of a run-and-gun type of player, Locus has a shield ability and looks similar to the slide and shotgun play of a Titan from <em>Destiny 2</em>. The final runner in the alpha test is Blackbird, designed for recon and scanning the area around you. While there are four runners in the alpha test, there will be six to choose from when <em>Marathon </em>launches in September.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During its livestream, Bungie published a nearly 20-minute video of highlights from 40 creators it says it recently invited to try the game. </p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Marathon | Creator Alpha Gameplay Highlights\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlC31D_Rr-Y?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you die, you&#8217;ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up. Teammates can also revive you if you fail a mission.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bungie isn&#8217;t putting a limit on team compositions, so that means everyone on a three-person team can select the same runner. There will be end-game challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div><div><iframe title=\"Marathon | Reveal Cinematic Short\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fvbEnWLRo1s?rel=0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;\"></iframe></div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bungie has even produced an original short cinematic that&#8217;s set in the <em>Marathon </em>universe. Written and directed by Alberto Mielgo (<em>Love, Death, and Robots</em>), this nearly nine-minute short will have Bungie fans poring over it for days to discover every little detail about the <em>Marathon</em> universe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While <em>Marathon </em>is very slick-looking, there’s a lot riding on this game. It’s entering a crowded market of shooters and live-service games that have tried and failed to break through in recent years. <em>Concord</em>, also from a PlayStation studio, was the biggest example of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios\">shooter that failed to take off</a> recently, forcing Sony to take the game offline less than a month after launch and eventually shut down the studio behind it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Spectre Divide</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>-like free-to-play shooter, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/628698/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down\">also shut down</a> just months after its launch, with the developer behind the ambitious shooter shutting down, too. These high-profile failures add to the pressure that <em>Marathon</em> is already under on the back of Bungie’s success with <em>Halo</em> and <em>Destiny</em> and Sony’s ambitious live-service game effort that it has been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345575/sony-god-of-war-bluepoint-games-bend-games-canceled\">scaling back recently</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <em>Marathon</em> alpha test will be an opportunity for Bungie to show the world exactly how its latest game will stand out from the competition, and whether it does enough to tempt people away from hero shooters or <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> into the extraction shooter genre that <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> has popularized.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The big question left for Bungie to answer is how much <em>Marathon</em> will cost.

It’s a long-awaited title from Bungie and revives the classic Marathon IP in the form of a PvPvE extraction shooter. After a teaser nearly two years ago, the Sony-owned studio just spent an hour showing off Marathon gameplay and game mechanics and revealed the game will launch on September 23rd on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC, with full cross-play and cross-save. There’s even an alpha test for fans to try out the game later this month, ahead of its full debut this year.\nMarathon is set in a sci-fi universe in 2850, in the remains of Tau Ceti IV, which Bungie describes as a lost colony whose inhabitants disappeared without a trace. Rival factions have hired Runners to scavenge for what’s left behind, and anyone who signs up to be a Runner has given up their human form for a biosynthetic shell with unique abilities and stats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a Runner, you fight in a crew of up to three players across a variety of zones and points of interest. You can face rival runners in maps of up to 18 players, so up to six teams, in a bid to grab as much loot as possible and get out. While Marathon is designed to be played in crews, with contextual pings and shared objectives, you can also play solo instead of having to form a dedicated three-person team.\nIn Marathon runs, there will be what Bungie calls security forces, PvE enemies that roam the world. There are also creatures on these planets that are a threat when you’re navigating toward points on a map. You’ll have to choose whether it’s worth engaging with these enemies and risk revealing your location to rival teams or use a strategy of avoiding these threats in this PvPvE environment.\nThe maps are filled with bold and vibrant artwork and weapons, materials, and equipment that can be scavenged. Before a run, you build a loadout and select the Runner that fits your play style. In the alpha test, which starts on April 23rd, there will be four runners to choose from, including the stealthy Void character that can go invisible much like a Hunter from Destiny 2. \nThere’s also a Glitch runner that has fast-paced abilities and, like its name implies, can glitch out enemies. If you’re more of a run-and-gun type of player, Locus has a shield ability and looks similar to the slide and shotgun play of a Titan from Destiny 2. The final runner in the alpha test is Blackbird, designed for recon and scanning the area around you. While there are four runners in the alpha test, there will be six to choose from when Marathon launches in September.\nDuring its livestream, Bungie published a nearly 20-minute video of highlights from 40 creators it says it recently invited to try the game. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you die, you’ll drop your gear. But if you survive, your loot moves with you to future runs so you get more powerful gear and level up. Teammates can also revive you if you fail a mission.\nBungie isn’t putting a limit on team compositions, so that means everyone on a three-person team can select the same runner. There will be end-game challenges, ranked play, seasonal storytelling, community events, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBungie has even produced an original short cinematic that’s set in the Marathon universe. Written and directed by Alberto Mielgo (Love, Death, and Robots), this nearly nine-minute short will have Bungie fans poring over it for days to discover every little detail about the Marathon universe.\nWhile Marathon is very slick-looking, there’s a lot riding on this game. It’s entering a crowded market of shooters and live-service games that have tried and failed to break through in recent years. Concord, also from a PlayStation studio, was the biggest example of a shooter that failed to take off recently, forcing Sony to take the game offline less than a month after launch and eventually shut down the studio behind it.\nSpectre Divide, a Valorant-like free-to-play shooter, also shut down just months after its launch, with the developer behind the ambitious shooter shutting down, too. These high-profile failures add to the pressure that Marathon is already under on the back of Bungie’s success with Halo and Destiny and Sony’s ambitious live-service game effort that it has been scaling back recently.\nThe Marathon alpha test will be an opportunity for Bungie to show the world exactly how its latest game will stand out from the competition, and whether it does enough to tempt people away from hero shooters or Call of Duty and Fortnite into the extraction shooter genre that Escape from Tarkov has popularized.\nThe big question left for Bungie to answer is how much Marathon will cost. It’s not a free-to-play game, but the studio isn’t ready to talk about exact pricing just yet. Destiny 2 is technically free-to-play with an optional season pass, but a lot of additional content requires payment for access to raids, dungeons, and even some of the story content. It’s been a confusing model for new players over the years, so I’m hoping Bungie lands on a clear pricing structure for Marathon.\nMarathon debuts on PS5, Xbox Series S / X, and PC on September 23rd. You can sign up for the Marathon closed alpha test on Bungie’s website or on Discord.","summary":"The creators of Halo and Destiny are finally ready to show off their next big project: Marathon.

You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’t <em>just</em> for athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last <em>weeks</em> on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, however, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/636211/garmin-connect-plus-subscription-wearables\">the company recently announced</a> it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we test Garmin watches</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">There are fitness trackers and smartwatches, and then there are Garmins. Depending on the type of Garmin — there are&nbsp;<em>many&nbsp;</em>— we will tailor our benchmarks and experiential, real-life testing. If it&#8217;s a rugged Fenix model, we&#8217;ll go on extensive GPS activities, see how well it works as a navigation tool, and dive deep into training metrics. If it&#8217;s more lifestyle focused, like the Venu 3, we&#8217;ll put an added focus on how well smart features like voice assistant access, notifications, and style. Because people buy Garmins to last a long time, we also put special consideration on battery life testing. Some other factors we consider are durability, performance, ability to connect to gym equipment, and GPS accuracy.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Battery life</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Garmins are known for extra long battery life. The question is, does it last days, weeks, or even a month?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Training metrics </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Garmin has so many training features that even the pros probably don’t use all of them. Do you get coaching programs and stamina graphs? Or are you sticking to the basics like steps, pace, and mileage?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Navigational features </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Same goes for navigational features. While Garmin is known for its GPS tech, there are multiple kinds of GPS tracking and satellite systems. We also look at whether these navigational features fit the use case. For example, do running watches have <a href=\"https://www8.garmin.com/manuals/webhelp/forerunner245/EN-US/GUID-CF774818-0C30-4992-962C-DDA9EA00E8C6.html#:~:text=During%20an%20activity%2C%20select%20STOP,straight%20line%2C%20select%20Straight%20Line.\">back-to-start</a>? Do offline maps come preloaded for thru-hikers?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Style and durability</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Do these watches hold up to intense activity? Are they discreet enough to wear to formal occasions without screaming “I love exercise!!!!!”</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Value</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Garmins are expensive. Does the price make sense for the intended user, feature set, and build quality?</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>Garmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and <a href=\"https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=XW4TwGAinJ2juGDNiANMt8\">several of the latest Garmins</a> recently got <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/24/23567610/garmin-venu-2-plus-ekg-fda\">an FDA-cleared EKG feature</a>. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>There are a <em>lot </em>of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#r3gA2c\">The best Garmin for runners</a></li><li><a href=\"#qIpmSw\">The best Garmin for endurance sports</a></li><li><a href=\"#LbhNb5\">The best Garmin on a budget</a></li><li><a href=\"#ldPveO\">The best Garmin to replace a Fitbit</a></li><li><a href=\"#ZLn31D\">The best Garmin smartwatch</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"r3gA2c\">The best Garmin for runners</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong> 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / <strong>Weight:</strong> 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / <strong>Battery life:</strong> Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / <strong>Display type:</strong> OLED touchscreen / <strong>GPS:</strong> All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> 5ATM / <strong>Music storage:</strong> 8GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Garmin has <em>many </em>running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23171721/garmin-forerunner-255s-review-running-watch\">Forerunner 255</a>, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255’s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24483620/236554_Garmin_Forerunner_265S_AKrales_0072.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close-up of the Garmin Forerunner 265S on the wrist of a person putting their hand into a jacket pocket.\" title=\"Close-up of the Garmin Forerunner 265S on the wrist of a person putting their hand into a jacket pocket.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 42mm Forerunner 265S fits on my petite wrists well. Plus, it’s lightweight, so it won’t distract you while running.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>The 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don’t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.</p>\n\n<p>My main complaint is that $450, while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24107020/garmin-forerunner-165-music-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Forerunner 165</a> series. It starts at $250 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered.</p>\n\n<p>Neither has all of<strong> </strong>Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"z26nCl\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23632332/garmin-forerunner-265s-review-oled-smartwatch-running\">Read my full Garmin Forerunner 265S review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"qIpmSw\">The best Garmin for endurance sports</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong> 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps / <strong>Weight:</strong> 42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium / <strong>Battery life: </strong>42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) / <strong>Display type:</strong> OLED / <strong>GPS:</strong> All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / <strong>Water resistance:</strong> 10ATM / <strong>Music storage:</strong> Up to 32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23759824/garmin-epix-2-pro-review-smartwatch\">Epix Pro</a> will get you every fitness feature that Garmin has to offer. And I mean <em>everything</em>. It would frankly be easier to tell you what the Epix Pro does not have: things that are limited to LTE smartwatches and some of the new smart features on the Fenix 8, like an on-board voice assistant. Otherwise, you’ve got topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with.</p>\n\n<p>The Pro is more size-inclusive than the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22934516/garmin-epix-2-review\">standard second-gen Epix</a>, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix.</p>\n\n<p>That said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22937154/garmin-fenix-7s-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch\">Fenix 7</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23809801/garmin-fenix-7s-pro-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Fenix 7 Pro</a>, and now, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24266434/garmin-fenix-8-review-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracking\">Fenix 8</a>. The main difference is the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where<strong> </strong>most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.</p>\n\n<p>Not helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED or a MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is the starting price is now $350 more than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.</p>\n\n<p>But really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons.

You’ll find these fitness trackers and smartwatches on dozens of wrists at any 5K, marathon, or Ironman. You’ll also find Garmin devotees among divers, thru-hikers, golfers, kiteboarders — you name it. But these devices aren’t just for athletes. The company’s made significant strides in its lifestyle offerings, so regardless of your fitness level, there’s a Garmin for everyone.\nIf you’re coming from a more traditional smartwatch, Garmin’s core strengths lie in fitness, GPS, adventuring, and durability. These are hardy devices that are meant to withstand the elements and last weeks on a single charge. Several models come with offline maps, advanced navigational features, and more training metrics than any other platform. Garmin devices tend to be on the pricier side, however, and the company recently announced it would begin putting its newest features behind a paywall. That’s a bummer given Garmin spent years publicly stating it had no intention of charging its users extra.\n\n\nHow we test Garmin watches\nThere are fitness trackers and smartwatches, and then there are Garmins. Depending on the type of Garmin — there are many — we will tailor our benchmarks and experiential, real-life testing. If it’s a rugged Fenix model, we’ll go on extensive GPS activities, see how well it works as a navigation tool, and dive deep into training metrics. If it’s more lifestyle focused, like the Venu 3, we’ll put an added focus on how well smart features like voice assistant access, notifications, and style. Because people buy Garmins to last a long time, we also put special consideration on battery life testing. Some other factors we consider are durability, performance, ability to connect to gym equipment, and GPS accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life\nGarmins are known for extra long battery life. The question is, does it last days, weeks, or even a month?\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining metrics \nGarmin has so many training features that even the pros probably don’t use all of them. Do you get coaching programs and stamina graphs? Or are you sticking to the basics like steps, pace, and mileage?\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigational features \nSame goes for navigational features. While Garmin is known for its GPS tech, there are multiple kinds of GPS tracking and satellite systems. We also look at whether these navigational features fit the use case. For example, do running watches have back-to-start? Do offline maps come preloaded for thru-hikers?\n\n\n\n\n\nStyle and durability\nDo these watches hold up to intense activity? Are they discreet enough to wear to formal occasions without screaming “I love exercise!!!!!”\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nGarmins are expensive. Does the price make sense for the intended user, feature set, and build quality?\n\n\nGarmins aren’t too shabby on smarts, either. While more fitness-focused than anything from Apple, Google, or Samsung, there’s enough to get you the basics like notifications and then some. For example, most Garmins have fall detection and safety features, and several of the latest Garmins recently got an FDA-cleared EKG feature. (You’ll need a phone on hand, however, as only one Garmin model has cellular connectivity.) Many Garmin devices also support offline music playback and come with a small third-party app ecosystem.\nThere are a lot of Garmin watches to choose from. No, seriously, there are six major lineups, and each has a multitude of models. But no worries — I test several Garmins every year and can help point you in the right direction.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Garmin for runners\nThe best Garmin for endurance sports\nThe best Garmin on a budget\nThe best Garmin to replace a Fitbit\nThe best Garmin smartwatch\n\nThe best Garmin for runners\nSizes: 42mm w/ 18mm straps; 46mm w/ 22mm straps / Weight: 39g (42mm); 47g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 15 days (42mm); 13 days (46mm) in smartwatch mode / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 8GB\nGarmin has many running watches, and a lot of them are great. But the Forerunner 265 or 265S (if you have petite wrists) strikes an excellent balance between price, feature set, battery life, and a vibrant OLED display.\nThat said, the Forerunner 265 / 265S is a bit of an odd duck. It comes a mere nine months after its predecessor, the Forerunner 255, and is, in many ways, pretty much the same watch. The main difference is the 265 has an OLED display compared to the 255’s memory-in-pixel screen. Usually, that means worse battery life, but in this case, we got about a week on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. Without it, you can get up to 15 days. Given that OLED is easier to read and just, well, looks nicer, that gives the 265 lineup an edge over the 255.\nThe 265 also has dual-frequency GPS (also known as multi-band). The gist is you get much more accurate maps in challenging environments like cities and dense forests because you can access both the L1 and L5 satellite frequencies. And even with dual-frequency GPS enabled, you still don’t lose a whole lot of battery life. I wore it during a half marathon with that and the AOD enabled, and I still had over 80 percent battery by the time I got home. This is also an excellent price, as the majority of multi-band GPS watches cost well over $600.\nMy main complaint is that $450, while not bad for Garmin, is still a lot when you consider that’s the same price as smarter smartwatches with great running features. Some runners won’t care. But if you’re on a budget — or you’re new to running and feel iffy about spending that much — then consider the Forerunner 165 series. It starts at $250 (add another $50 for onboard music) and does almost everything the 265 series does. The main things you’re missing are dual-frequency GPS and a few more niche sport profiles. But if you’re mostly sticking to running, gym equipment, cycling, swimming, and hiking, you’re covered.\nNeither has all of Garmin’s training features, but it’s got what you’ll need to run anything from a 5K to a full marathon. That includes a Race Predictor, which gives you an estimate of what your best time would be based on your actual training. You can also use PacePro to figure out your pacing strategy for a race. You also get Garmin’s Training Readiness feature to help gauge load and recovery, Garmin Coach plans, and a host of running form metrics. It also supports offline music and safety features like fall detection. The only thing they lack is advanced mapping. (They still have trackback, point-to-point navigation, and real-time breadcrumb trail support, however.)\nRead my full Garmin Forerunner 265S review.\nThe best Garmin for endurance sports\nSizes: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 42mm: 63g stainless steel, 58g titanium; 47mm: 78g stainless steel, 70g titanium; 51mm: 98g stainless steel, 88g titanium / Battery life: 42mm: up to 10 days (4 with AOD); 47mm: up to 16 days (6 with AOD); 51mm: up to 31 days (11 with AOD) / Display type: OLED / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GB\nThe Epix Pro will get you every fitness feature that Garmin has to offer. And I mean everything. It would frankly be easier to tell you what the Epix Pro does not have: things that are limited to LTE smartwatches and some of the new smart features on the Fenix 8, like an on-board voice assistant. Otherwise, you’ve got topographical maps, turn-by-turn navigation, and more training metrics than even a seasoned triathlete would know what to do with.\nThe Pro is more size-inclusive than the standard second-gen Epix, which only comes in 47mm. You can get the Pro in that size, too, but it also comes in 42mm and 51mm. This was a major complaint I had with the second-gen Epix, and you love to see companies actually take this sort of thing seriously. The best part is the Pro models start at the same price as the regular Epix did. You’ll have to pay $100 extra for materials like titanium and sapphire crystal, but that’s also true of the standard Epix.\nThat said, it muddies the waters if you’re trying to pick between the Epix Pro, Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, and now, the Fenix 8. The main difference is the Epix watches all have OLED displays. One reason I prefer OLED is that they’re much easier to read indoors — where most of us spend the majority of our time. The Fenix 7 series’ memory-in-pixel displays (plus solar charging if you opt for it) allow for weeks and weeks of charge, but the smallest Epix Pro can get around 10 days with normal usage. The 47mm and 51mm Pro models can go longer between charges due to bigger batteries, but I felt that the 42mm has enough juice to satisfy most use cases. Garmin also has so many battery-saving modes and options that I highly doubt this will ever be an issue.\nNot helping matters is the fact that the Fenix 8 lets you choose between an OLED or a MIP display. You also get smart features like an onboard voice assistant, the ability to take calls from the wrist, and the Garmin Messenger app. The main problem is the starting price is now $350 more than the standard Fenix 7 and right about on par with the Epix Pro. My personal feeling is the Fenix 8’s smart features are just okay and that you’re really not missing much by not having them. We also often see discounts on older models, so I would put on my bargain-hunting hat for a discounted Epix Pro or Fenix 7 Pro while inventory is still available.\nBut really, the winning feature of the Epix Pro is the hands-free flashlight. It’s so useful in my day-to-day life, and all you have to do is double-press a button. It’s as bright as your smartphone, comes with a red light option if you want something easier on the eyes, and can act as a strobe in an emergency situation. The Fenix 7 Pro and 8 watches also have a flashlight, so a lot of this is going to come down to personal preference for the display, price, and whether you care about smart features.\nIf you’re set on the most battery life possible, I recommend the Fenix 7 Pro over the standard 7 for a few reasons. Its MIP display is slightly brighter, all sizes have the flashlight, and, like the Epix Pro, it has an updated sensor array. I also recommend it over the MIP versions of the Fenix 8 because it comes in more sizes, and costs around $300 less. Especially since the Fenix 8’s smart features are a bit half-baked.\nRead my full Epix Pro review.\nThe best Garmin on a budget\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 19g / Battery life: Up to 5 days / Display type: “Hidden” OLED touchscreen / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nWhat I love most about the Vivomove Sport is that it doesn’t look like what most people expect from a Garmin.
