Because the lunar samples shared strong similarities with Earth rocks, this added weight to the idea that the Moon was formed when a Mars-sized object called Theia collided with the proto-Earth roughly <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-earth-031621-060538\">4.5 billion years ago</a>.</p>\n<p>Debris from the impact was thrown into orbit around Earth and eventually coalesced into the Moon. In its early days, the Moon was entirely molten. As the magma ocean cooled over hundreds of millions of years, the Moon formed a crust and a mantle below. Giant pools of lava filled impact craters and settled into the lunar lowlands, or maria (Latin for “seas”), while highlands and volcanic domes loomed above them. Eventually, the volcanism died out.</p>\n<p>Without plate tectonics or weather, the only things left to alter the Moon’s cold, dead surface were meteorites. A lot of the Apollo-era samples were found to have formed from the heat and pressure of impacts around 3.9 billion years ago, suggesting that they were the result of a short period of intense pummeling by space rocks called the Late Heavy Bombardment.</p>\n<p>But research since the 1970s has refined or changed this picture. Higher-resolution orbital images have revealed plenty of large impact craters that seem far older than 3.9 billion years, for example. And meteorites found on Earth, thought to have been ejected from various areas of the Moon during big impacts, have been found to span a huge range of ages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5602003/\">All this work together suggests</a> that the asteroid bombardment didn’t happen in one dramatic spike but rather over an extended period lasting from perhaps 4.2 billion to 3.4 billion years ago. In this scenario, the Apollo samples dated to 3.9 billion years likely all came from just one huge impact that spewed rock over a very wide area that happened to include the Apollo-era landing sites.</p>\n<h2>The Moon: Dead or alive</h2>\n<p>Greater mysteries surround volcanism on the Moon. “The canonical thing I learned in school was that the Moon had been geologically dead for billions of years,” says Samuel Lawrence, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston.</p>\n<p>The long-held theory was that a small body like the Moon should have lost its heat to space relatively quickly—and a frigid, extinguished Moon shouldn’t have widespread volcanic activity. Apollo-era samples suggested that most of this volcanism stopped 3 billion years ago or earlier, supporting the theory. But research over the past two decades has overturned that view.</p>\n<img width=\"640\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/g-geologic-map-moon-640x320.jpg\" class=\"none medium\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/g-geologic-map-moon-640x320.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/g-geologic-map-moon-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/g-geologic-map-moon-768x384.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/g-geologic-map-moon-980x490.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/g-geologic-map-moon.jpg 1201w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\">\n      This geologic map of the Moon released in 2022 by China is the most detailed global map yet published and includes information gleaned from the 2020 Chang’e-5 mission.\n        Credit:\n          <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\" target=\"_blank\">J.

In 2020, the Chang’e-5 robotic mission landed in Oceanus Procellarum (the Ocean of Storms) — a spot picked in part because it looked geologically young given how few craters had accumulated there. Sure enough, the volcanic rocks brought home by that mission were found to be <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl7957\">2 billion years old</a>, the youngest ever retrieved from the Moon. “That was big news,” says planetary geoscientist Jim Head of Brown University, who worked on NASA’s Apollo missions.</p>\n<p>On top of this, when researchers trawled through thousands of glass beads found in the Chang’e-5 soil samples, most of which are thought to have been created by impacts, they identified three that were volcanic—and only <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adk6635\">120 million years old</a>. This finding was published just last year and still needs to be verified, but if such recent dates hold up, they suggest that the Moon might <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr9336\">still be capable of producing deep magma even today</a>, Yin says.</p>\n<p>All this indicates that the Moon might not have cooled as fast as everyone thought it did. It’s also possible that some of the younger volcanism could have been powered by radioactive elements underground, which can generate enough heat to form magma and are known to be prevalent in certain patches of the Moon. This could explain the 120-million-year-old volcanic glass beads, for example. But not all the early volcanism can be explained this way: The Chang’e-5 volcanic rocks, along with some 2.8-billion-year-old volcanic rock brought back from the far side by Chang’e-6, came from source rocks <em>not </em>enriched with these elements.</p>\n<p>“It throws up more questions than it answers,” Neal says. “It’s job security for people like me — we now have new questions to address.”<!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Lunar exploration ahead</h2>\n<p>Untangling these mysteries is challenging with so much of the Moon unexplored: While about 850 pounds of Moon rock and soil have now been brought back to Earth, it has all been from just a handful of sites.</p>\n<p>Chang’e-6 expanded this picture by bringing back the first samples from the Moon’s far side, taken from the South Pole-Aitken Basin, the satellite’s largest, deepest and oldest impact crater.

That's because the company has decided that purchasing the cars is cheaper—and likely easier—than identifying and replacing defective battery packs.

Good question—after all, Jaguars are not renowned for being paragons of reliability. 2019 was also the first year for the I-Pace, and buying a car in its first model can be a risky move as unanticipated manufacturing and parts problems rear their heads.
