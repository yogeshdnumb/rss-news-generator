But that’s often what our deal hunters at <em>The Verge </em>are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CM2y8j\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">iPad (2022)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\"><strong>10th-gen iPad</strong></a> came out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">Apple’s latest entry-level model</a>, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1924288816\">Walmart</a> starting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLBNNRT/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1497747190\">Walmart</a> are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for just shy of $350 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/\">starting at $299</a> ($100 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-2025-deals\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review\">iPad (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As noted above, <strong>Apple’s 11th-gen iPad</strong> just recently landed on the scene. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">new base-model tablet</a> is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven’t seen significant price drops yet, though the entry-level model is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ751XN6/?th=1\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver/15483805722\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-a16-10-9-inch-wi-fi-128gb-2025-11th-generation-blue/-/A-85966318\">Target</a> starting at around $299 ($50 off) right now. Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ773FRV/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Silver/15419323073\">Walmart</a> starting at $399 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ75HDQ4/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue/15462502488\">Walmart</a> starting at $599 ($50 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"njqbEo\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review\">iPad Mini (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>The new <strong>seventh-gen iPad Mini</strong> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\">the outgoing model</a> but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering&nbsp;if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-ipad-mini-a17-pro-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578253.p?skuId=6578253\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-128gb-2024-space-gray/-/A-85966283\">Target</a> for around $399 ($100 off), matching its lowest price to date.

That’s the best price we’ve seen on both of the step-up configurations.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-air-2024-deals\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025\">best iPad Air (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>2025 iPad Air</strong> is little more than a spec bump over the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024\">previous model</a>, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-11-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578280.p?skuId=6578280\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-air-m3-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/-/A-91122029/\">Target</a> in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at around $499 ($50 off). Amazon also has the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76RM7P/\">256GB model for around $599</a> ($100 off) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ7466KC/\">512GB model for around $799</a> ($100 off), as does <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-11-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578280.p?skuId=6578280\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-air-m3-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/-/A-91122029?preselect=85966355\">Target</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76QBLQ/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-13-inch-ipad-air-m3-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6578297.p?skuId=6578297\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-air-m3-13-inch-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/-/A-91122010\">Target</a> with 128GB of storage starting at around $699 ($100 off).

The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24148451/apple-m4-chip-ai-ipad-macbook\">M4 chip</a>, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.</p>\n\n<p>As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-11-inch-ipad-pro-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-256gb-with-oled-space-black/5495362.p?skuId=5495362\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-ipad-pro-11-inch-m4-2024-5th-generation-wifi-256gb-with-standard-glass-space-black/-/A-85966229/\">Target</a> starting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price.

Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips.\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\nApple’s 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by Apple’s latest entry-level model, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nRight now, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Walmart starting at $299 ($50 off), which is $40 more than its best price to date. Amazon and Walmart are also selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for just shy of $350 ($150 off), which is a better deal when you consider you can currently grab an 11th-gen iPad with an expanded 128GB of storage at Amazon starting at $299 ($100 off).\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\nAs noted above, Apple’s 11th-gen iPad just recently landed on the scene. The new base-model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.\nPricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We haven’t seen significant price drops yet, though the entry-level model is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Target starting at around $299 ($50 off) right now. Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model at Amazon and Walmart starting at $399 ($50 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon and Walmart starting at $599 ($50 off).\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\nRight now, the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for around $399 ($100 off), matching its lowest price to date. You can also pick up the 256GB variant at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $499 ($100 off), or the 512GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for $699 ($100 off). That’s the best price we’ve seen on both of the step-up configurations.\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\nThe 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.\nThe 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at around $499 ($50 off). Amazon also has the 256GB model for around $599 ($100 off) and the 512GB model for around $799 ($100 off), as does Best Buy and Target.\nThe larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target with 128GB of storage starting at around $699 ($100 off). You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model at Amazon starting at $776.50 (about $123 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at around $999 ($100 off), which remains its lowest price to date.\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\nThe 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade than the latest iPad Air. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.\nAs for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $1,099 ($200 off), which matches the lowest price we’ve seen.","summary":"While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Prime Day, many great iPad deals are attainable outside of those times.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-apple-watch-se-deals\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#zdhvKu\">The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#MpVWgd\">A note on the more premium models</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch\">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s get to the deals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p>\n\n<p>While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Series 9</a>. That being said, it’s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11385157008\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-series-10-gps-42mm-aluminum-case-with-black-sport-band-s-m-jet-black-2024/6572678.p?skuId=6572678\">Best Buy</a> right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($100 off), which remains its best price to date.

It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/dp/B0DGJ736JM/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M/11451150677\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-se-2nd-generation-gps-40mm-aluminum-case-with-midnight-sport-band-s-m-midnight-2024/6572654.p?skuId=6572654\">Best Buy</a>, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for an all-time low of $169 ($80 off).

The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.</p>\n\n<p>In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHZ13GG/\">with a Trail Loop</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHNX1SH/\">an Alpine Loop</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHRGSH3/\">an Ocean Band</a> starting at $729.99 (about $69 off).

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Series 6 and newer models, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299 ($100 off), which remains its best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $329 ($100 off) — which is the best price we’ve seen on the larger configuration — while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Walmart starting at $399 ($100 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\nRight now, the best deal on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for an all-time low of $169 ($80 off). The 44mm / GPS configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $199 (also $80 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale at Walmart starting at $199 ($130 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at around $219 (about $79 off).\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon with a Trail Loop, an Alpine Loop, or an Ocean Band starting at $729.99 (about $69 off). You can also pick it up at Best Buy or Target, though only for its full retail price of $799.\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.","summary":"In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

Unfiltered, the resonance could “disrupt the hard drive’s proper operation long enough for it to result in the operating system crashing.” The issue even got its <a href=\"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38392\">own entry in the NIST National Vulnerability Database</a>, which says it affected 5,400rpm hard drives for certain machines “in approximately 2005 and later.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chen, who says he was curious how long the filter in place, writes this week that he has since learned that after Microsoft introduced a new rule for Windows 7 saying that users must be able to disable all audio processing on their computers, a hardware vendor asked for an exception. Chen writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The vendor applied for an exception to this rule on the grounds that disabling their APO could result in physical damage to the computer. If it were possible to disable their APO, word would get out that “You can get heavier bass if you go through these steps,” and of course you want more bass, right?
