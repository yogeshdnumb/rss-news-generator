They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Several services offer ongoing promos, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike.

A monthly subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). The $15.99 per month service includes Dolby Atmos sound, as well as the ability to download TV shows and movies on up to 10 devices.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For just a dollar more, <a href=\"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fhelp.disneyplus.com%2Farticle%2Fdisneyplus-disney-bundle%23price\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disney offers</a> an ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu.

That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you want all three.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, there are other ways to save, particularly with carrier promos.<strong> </strong>Those currently on <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeStreamingServiceDeals011223/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/\">one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans</a>, for instance, can get Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11557999?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsolutions-and-services%2Fdisneyplus%2F\">for $10 a month</a> instead of $16.99.

No matter which you buy, you’ll be able to access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices, including originals like <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/611243/the-handmaids-tale-season-6-premiere-date-trailer\">The Handmaid’s Tale</a> </em>and<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24141497/sand-land-game-anime-hulu-ps5-xbox-akira-toriyama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Sand Land</em></a><em>, </em>as well as other content, like <em>Shogun</em>, <em>The Bear</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24206898/futurama-season-12-review-hulu-nft-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Futurama</em></a>, and <em>The Veil</em>. The service also allows two people to stream simultaneously, and you can have up to six user profiles. However, subscribing to the ad-free plan means you won’t have to deal with commercials; You’ll also be able to watch downloads offline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://help.hulu.com/article/hulu-what-is-hulu#features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-supported plan</a> currently costs $9.99 per month, while the <a href=\"https://help.hulu.com/article/hulu-no-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-free plan</a> costs $18.99 a month. Hulu also sells ad-free and ad-supported bundles that include Disney Plus and / or ESPN Plus, which are cheaper than subscribing to each service individually. With the Hulu with Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus bundle, you’ll be able to access more than 90 live sports, news, and entertainment channels, as well as content from each of the streaming services. You’ll also be able to record live shows with unlimited DVR storage and take advantage of the same features the standard, ad-free, and ad-supported Hulu plans offer. The <a href=\"https://www.hulu.com/start/affiliate-liveTV?cmp=8870&amp;utm_campaign=brand&amp;utm_source=Affiliate&amp;utm_medium=Rakuten&amp;ranMID=42392&amp;ranEAID=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;ranSiteID=nOD_rLJHOac-KxqSa_t06KOrWpUR_oHbTg&amp;siteID=nOD_rLJHOac-KxqSa_t06KOrWpUR_oHbTg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-supported Hulu with Live TV subscription is $82.99 a month</a>, while the <a href=\"https://signup.hulu.com/plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-free tier is $95.99 a month</a> (though, it’s worth noting that, of the three services included, ESPN Plus will still have ads, even at this tier). Complicated, right?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, if you just want Hulu and don’t need the live TV version, you can subscribe to the ad-supported Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney Plus, for $10.99 a month. You can also add ESPN Plus for $16.99 per month, or get rid of ads and add live sports for $26.99 a month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In terms of deals, students can subscribe to the <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;offerid=852731.649&amp;type=3&amp;u1=VergeStreamingServices011223\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-supported version for $1.99 a month</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/student/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bundle that combines Spotify Premium, Showtime, and ad-supported Hulu for $5.99 a month</a>.

With it, you can watch a range of streaming services as well as live and on-demand channels — including ESPN, CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, and Cartoon Network — on multiple devices.</p>\n\n<p>Sling offers an ad-supported free tier —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sling-tv.pxf.io/c/482924/1132376/14334?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Ffreestream&amp;subid1=VergeBestStreamingDeals021423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sling Freestream</a> — which provides access to more than 500 live channels as well as more than 40,000 on-demand movies and TV shows.

Sling Blue, however, offers a number of channels Sling Orange lacks, including Fox News, MSNBC, E!, Discovery, Bravo, and local NBC or Fox affiliates. You can also subscribe to a bundle that includes both Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which offers all the channels featured in the first two plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Sling is currently offering new customers a 50 percent discount on their first month of Sling Orange, meaning you’ll pay $23 instead of $45.99. The promo also applies to Sling Blue, although it’s slightly more expensive at $25.50, down from $50.99. You can also get one month of Sling Orange and Sling Blue combined for $33 per month instead of $65.99.

Unlike the ad-supported plan, the standard ad-free tier also lets you download 30 shows or movies for offline viewing. Max also offers a $20.99-a-month Premium plan, which allows you to stream in 4K and supports Dolby Atmos with select content. The latter plan also lets you stream on four devices simultaneously and download a maximum of 100 shows or movies to watch on the go.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Max offers an annual subscription and various bundles, both of which are cheaper than subscribing on a monthly basis. The <a href=\"https://www.max.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-supported plan normally costs $99.99 a year</a>, saving you a modest $19 over the course of 12 months, while <a href=\"https://www.max.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">subscribing to the annual ad-free base plan for $169.99</a> saves you $33.

The total cost is cheaper than subscribing to each of the three individually, saving you money in the long run.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, the streaming platform is running a promotion, allowing you to save even more on the cost of an annual plan. Now through May 7th, Max’s annual <a href=\"https://www.max.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-supported Basic plan</a> is discounted to $79.99 ($20 off), while the <a href=\"https://www.max.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-free Standard tier</a> is discounted to $139.99 (also $20 off).

But if you, like many of us, have more concurrent subscriptions than you care to admit, you’ll agree that keeping up with the latest each month is expensive. They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up.\nIf you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Several services offer ongoing promos, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie for less than it would typically cost you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nThe best Hulu deals\nThe best Peacock deals\nThe best Sling TV deals\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nThe best Max deals\nThe best Netflix deals\nThe best YouTube TV deals\nThe best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals\nThe best Starz deals\nThe best Amazon Prime Video deals\n\nNote: keep an eye out for free trials and student discounts\nMost streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. However, you will likely have to provide your credit card information in advance, and you will be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar if you don’t want to be charged.\nSome streaming platforms offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your student eligibility through a sign-up form and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals.\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nWith Disney Plus, you can stream a wide range of shows and movies, including Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, Deadpool & Wolverine, Andor, X-Men ‘97, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film. A monthly subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). The $15.99 per month service includes Dolby Atmos sound, as well as the ability to download TV shows and movies on up to 10 devices.\nFor just a dollar more, Disney offers an ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu. To enjoy an ad-free experience across both services, the cost is $19.99 per month.\nThere’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying $26.99 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus, though ESPN will still have ads). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you want all three.\nThat being said, there are other ways to save, particularly with carrier promos. Those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans, for instance, can get Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 a month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s existing Legacy bundle, you can also continue to enjoy ad-free Disney Plus, as well as ad-supported ESPN Plus and Hulu, for $15 per month ($6 off).\nThe best Hulu deals\nHulu offers both ad-supported and ad-free plans. No matter which you buy, you’ll be able to access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices, including originals like The Handmaid’s Tale and Sand Land, as well as other content, like Shogun, The Bear, Futurama, and The Veil. The service also allows two people to stream simultaneously, and you can have up to six user profiles. However, subscribing to the ad-free plan means you won’t have to deal with commercials; You’ll also be able to watch downloads offline.\nThe ad-supported plan currently costs $9.99 per month, while the ad-free plan costs $18.99 a month. Hulu also sells ad-free and ad-supported bundles that include Disney Plus and / or ESPN Plus, which are cheaper than subscribing to each service individually. With the Hulu with Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus bundle, you’ll be able to access more than 90 live sports, news, and entertainment channels, as well as content from each of the streaming services. You’ll also be able to record live shows with unlimited DVR storage and take advantage of the same features the standard, ad-free, and ad-supported Hulu plans offer. The ad-supported Hulu with Live TV subscription is $82.99 a month, while the ad-free tier is $95.99 a month (though, it’s worth noting that, of the three services included, ESPN Plus will still have ads, even at this tier). Complicated, right?\nHowever, if you just want Hulu and don’t need the live TV version, you can subscribe to the ad-supported Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney Plus, for $10.99 a month. You can also add ESPN Plus for $16.99 per month, or get rid of ads and add live sports for $26.99 a month.\nIn terms of deals, students can subscribe to the ad-supported version for $1.99 a month or a bundle that combines Spotify Premium, Showtime, and ad-supported Hulu for $5.99 a month. Some wireless carriers are also offering customers discounts when they buy premium phone plans. As mentioned previously, those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans can get the Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 per month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s Legacy bundle, you can also continue to stream ad-free Disney Plus and ad-supported ESPN Plus / Hulu for $15 a month ($6 off). T-Mobile, meanwhile, is offers complimentary access to Hulu’s ad-supported tier when you maintain a qualifying Go5G Next line. \nThe best Peacock deals\nPeacock is NBCUniversal’s streaming service, one that offers next-day programming from NBC (and Bravo). The platform also provides access to live sports programming, including Sunday Night Football and WWE, as well as movies and shows like The Wild Robot, Conclave, Wicked, Oppenheimer, Yellowstone, Teacup, The Office, Saturday Night Live, and Rian Johnson’s Poker Face.\nThe platform currently offers two plans: an ad-supported Peacock Premium tier for $7.99 a month (or $79.99 a year) or the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier for $13.99 a month (or $139.99 a year). Only the latter lets you download content for offline viewing.\nIn terms of deals, you can grab a complimentary subscription when you sign up for a year of Instacart Plus ($99 annually or $9.99 a month). You can also get free access if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer with gigabit speeds or a Diamond or Platinum Rewards member.\nThe best Sling TV deals\nSling TV is a streaming service that functions as a more affordable alternative to YouTube TV and Hulu with Live TV. With it, you can watch a range of streaming services as well as live and on-demand channels — including ESPN, CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, and Cartoon Network — on multiple devices.\nSling offers an ad-supported free tier — Sling Freestream — which provides access to more than 500 live channels as well as more than 40,000 on-demand movies and TV shows.

Sling also lets you subscribe to Max as a Blue-tier add-on for a discount (totaling $57.97 per month), or you can buy an ad-free subscription to Max as a standalone service for $16.99 a month. \nIf you’re into sports, you may want to opt for Sling Orange over Blue as it grants access to ESPN channels — but only on one device. Sling Blue, however, offers a number of channels Sling Orange lacks, including Fox News, MSNBC, E!, Discovery, Bravo, and local NBC or Fox affiliates. You can also subscribe to a bundle that includes both Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which offers all the channels featured in the first two plans.\nSling is currently offering new customers a 50 percent discount on their first month of Sling Orange, meaning you’ll pay $23 instead of $45.99. The promo also applies to Sling Blue, although it’s slightly more expensive at $25.50, down from $50.99. You can also get one month of Sling Orange and Sling Blue combined for $33 per month instead of $65.99. In addition to 50 percent off your first month, Sling is also offering free unlimited DVR during that period, along with a $5 discount on Paramount Plus with Showtime, AMC Plus, or Starz.\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nApple TV Plus is a service operated by Apple that offers original shows and movies in 4K HDR, including Ted Lasso, The Studio, The Morning Show, Silo, Severance, Finch, Coda, For All Mankind, and Napoleon. The platform is also the streaming home to Major League Soccer, and currently costs $9.99 a month. There are no ads whatsoever on Apple TV Plus.\nThere are a couple of promos to make note of when it comes to Apple TV Plus. The service currently offers a weeklong free trial for new subscribers, after which you’ll be charged $9.99 a month. You can also get a free three-month subscription when you buy an Apple device, though you’ll have to redeem the offer within 90 days of purchase.\nApple TV Plus is also included in the larger Apple One suite of apps. The all-in-one service lets you bundle four other Apple services for a single monthly subscription starting at $19.95 a month. New subscribers will get a free month of Apple TV Plus if they include it as part of their Apple One membership. In addition, eligible individuals who sign up for the student Apple Music subscription, which starts at $5.99 per month, can get Apple Music for 50 percent off with a free Apple TV Plus subscription.\nAs far as carrier deals go, T-Mobile offers discounts on Apple TV Plus, as well as other streaming services. For instance, the wireless carrier is currently offering customers in the US complimentary access to Apple TV Plus when they subscribe to a qualifying Go5G Next line. For Verizon Unlimited customers, the option exists to get Apple One (which includes Apple TV Plus) for $10 per month ($9.95 off) for an individual plan, or $20 for a family plan ($5.95 off).\nThe best Max deals\nMax, formerly known as HBO Max, is home to Game of Thrones and its spinoff, House of the Dragon, along with shows and movies like Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Dune: Prophecy, The Last of Us, Wonka, Euphoria, Hacks, Scavenger’s Reign, The Batman, Succession, and even content from Discovery Plus.\nThe platform offers an ad-supported tier that costs $9.99 a month and two ad-free plans that start at $16.99 a month. Unlike the ad-supported plan, the standard ad-free tier also lets you download 30 shows or movies for offline viewing. Max also offers a $20.99-a-month Premium plan, which allows you to stream in 4K and supports Dolby Atmos with select content. The latter plan also lets you stream on four devices simultaneously and download a maximum of 100 shows or movies to watch on the go.\nMax offers an annual subscription and various bundles, both of which are cheaper than subscribing on a monthly basis. The ad-supported plan normally costs $99.99 a year, saving you a modest $19 over the course of 12 months, while subscribing to the annual ad-free base plan for $169.99 saves you $33. You can also save about $41 by subscribing to the annual 4K Premium ad-free plan for $209.99. Lastly, you can opt for the ad-supported bundle — which includes Max, Disney Plus, and Hulu — for $16.99 a month, or pay $13 extra to go ad-free. The total cost is cheaper than subscribing to each of the three individually, saving you money in the long run.\nFortunately, the streaming platform is running a promotion, allowing you to save even more on the cost of an annual plan. Now through May 7th, Max’s annual ad-supported Basic plan is discounted to $79.99 ($20 off), while the ad-free Standard tier is discounted to $139.99 (also $20 off). You can also subscribe to the Premium tier for $169.99, down from $209.99.\nMultiple wireless carriers are also offering deals.

Alternatively, Verizon is offering those with an Unlimited plan the ability to get Netflix and Max (with ads) for $10 a month (about $7 off). \nAT&T also includes complimentary access to ad-free Max when you subscribe to select AT&T Unlimited Choice or Plus plans, which start at $60 a month.

Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens and water resistance is often less robust than on a pricier phone.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"YvXuY9\">The best cheap iPhone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.1-inch, 1170p OLED / <strong>Processor:</strong> A18 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / <strong>Charging:</strong> 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP6</em></em>8</p>\n\n<p>If I was making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly <em>cheap.</em> If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai\">is underwhelming</a> and the most interesting bits <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought\">won’t arrive anytime soon</a>. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now.
