With it, you can generate a quick digital invitation that, when shared with your friends, lets them gather all the info about the event, RSVP, and add it to their calendar.

Creating an event using the plus button at the top of the Apple Invites app will let you type in a name and add time, date, and location details. You can also add an Apple-made background, pick a photo from your library, or, if you have a phone with Apple Intelligence support, whip up an AI-generated one using Apple’s Image Playground feature. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can invite people by picking from your contacts, manually entering phone numbers or email addresses, or copying a link to your event and sending it from outside the app. The app also lets you choose whether each person is allowed to invite others, and you can send notes to invitees after the event is created. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/Android-Apple-Invites.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,36.331384313576,100,27.337231372849\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Good news, everyone!&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The event’s info is shown with widgets, including one showing the weather forecast for that day and an Apple Maps box that you can tap to get directions.

For starters, where an iPhone user can go straight to the invitation using your link (assuming they’re already signed into iCloud), Android users have to enter their email address and then a verification code to get in.
