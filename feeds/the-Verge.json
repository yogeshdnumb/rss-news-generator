As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24th <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/654571/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-issues-problems\">was an absolute mess</a> — and GameStop <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/655626/nintendo-switch-2-gamestop-preorder\">didn’t fare much better</a> later in the week.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of right now, none of the aforementioned retailers are accepting reservations for the $449 gaming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is still <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/\">accepting sign-ups</a> for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements\">there are strict requirements</a>. Nintendo also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/655159/my-nintendo-store-switch-2-invites\">can’t guarantee an invite</a> ahead of launch due to “the very high demand” for the console. Surprising, I know.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don’t know when the next Switch 2 preorders will open up, at least at traditional US retailers. Additional preorder inventory has popped up intermittently at Walmart and GameStop in recent days; however, so far, none of the major retailers have announced when they will resume accepting preorders, if at all.

Both Best Buy and Walmart implemented a queue system when taking Switch 2 preorders in an effort to deter scalpers — a tactic also employed during the rollout of the PlayStation 5.

And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console.

What’s more, you must have opted in to share gameplay data with Nintendo (you can see if you’ve done so in the privacy section when logged into your account).\n\nConsole and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account …\n\n\nOnce invitations have been sent to account holders who have met these criteria, Nintendo says it will send invitations to “remaining eligible registrants” on a first-come, first-served basis. The invitations will be nontransferable and sent to the email address you provided while registering your interest with Nintendo. Console and accessory purchases will be limited to one per eligible account, at least during the initial invitation period, which will begin with the first batch of invitations on May 8th.\nAdditional invitations will follow periodically, though Nintendo hasn’t specified details beyond that. However, in a recent update to its site, Nintendo specified that, due to “the very high demand” for the console, “delivery by June 5 is not guaranteed” and that “your invitation email may arrive after the Nintendo Switch 2 launch.”\nWalmart\nWalmart is no longer accepting preorders for the standalone Switch 2 ($449) or the Mario Kart World bundle ($499), though you can still preorder games like Donkey Kong Bananza ($69) and accessories like the Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector ($39.88). That being said, Walmart’s website still indicates that, if you manage to preorder a console before 8AM ET on June 4th, you should receive it before 9AM ET on June 5th.\nGameStop\nGameStop currently isn’t accepting preorders for the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle. If you’re looking to bring the cost down in the future, though, it offers up to $175 off a Switch 2 when you trade in a Switch OLED, or up to $125 off when you trade in a regular Switch. In both instances, you’ll need everything that came with your console — specifically the Switch, its dock, two working Joy-Con controllers (with wrist straps), an HDMI cable, and a power cord. GameStop also confirmed to Gizmodo that the exact valuation will depend on the condition of your console, including whether your Joy-Cons are experiencing the dreaded stick drift.\nBest Buy\nBest Buy isn’t accepting online preorders for the standalone console or the Mario Kart World bundle right now, but if you do manage to reserve a console through Best Buy, the retailer has announced that most stores in the US will open at 12AM ET, 11PM CT, 10PM MT, and 9PM PT on June 5th for preorder pickup.\nAdditionally, if you’re a My Best Buy Plus or Total member, you can currently score $20 in credit for every $150 you spend (up to $100) on Nintendo games and gear (excluding all Switch and Switch 2 hardware). That privilege will run you at least $49.99 a year, though both membership tiers also grant you access to a number of exclusive perks, including limited-time discounts and free two-day shipping.\nTarget\nTarget has sold out of its initial preorder stock for both the standalone Switch 2 and the Mario Kart World bundle, along with many accessories. Some games, including the Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ($69.99), are still available.\nNewegg and Sam’s Club\nAs far as we know, neither Newegg nor Sam’s Club opened preorders on April 24th. However, Newegg has published a landing page for both the standalone console and the Mario Kart World bundle, indicating it will have Switch 2 stock at some point. The same applies to Sam’s Club, which currently has a retail listing for the bundle. You’ll need a Club membership ($50 a year) to take advantage of the latter; however, given Sam’s Club requires you to sign up for a premium subscription to shop, you might have better luck when preorders do open.\nUpdate, April 26th: Updated to include the latest information on Switch 2 preorders, along with several additional tips for securing Nintendo’s newest console at launch.","summary":"Following a brief delay stemming from the Trump administration’s on-again, off-again tariff policy, Nintendo officially opened up preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2. As expected, the initial rollout process at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers on April 24th was an absolute mess — and GameStop didn’t fare much better later in the week.
