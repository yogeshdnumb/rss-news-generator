The 501(c)(3) nonprofit behind it only cares about the accuracy of the information it provides and the speed with which the service can deliver that information. The app itself has taken off, rocketing to the top of Apple’s and Google’s app stores. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340260/the-watch-duty-wildfire-maps-app-has-been-downloaded-1-5-million-times-in-two-days\">Over 1 million people have downloaded</a> it over the last few days alone. </p>\n<p id=\"Yr8Viy\">The elegance of the app lies in its simplicity. It doesn’t scrape user data, show ads, require any kind of login, or track your information. Its simple tech stack and UI — most of which is maintained by volunteer engineers and reporters — has likely helped save countless lives. While Watch Duty is free to use, the app accepts tax-deductible donations and offers two tiers of membership that unlock additional features, like a firefighting flight tracker and the ability to set alerts for more than four counties.</p>\n<p id=\"ug3BrA\">With plans to expand the service across the United States, as well as overseas and into other emergency services, Watch Duty may eventually replace some of the slower <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340289/los-angeles-wildfire-wireless-emergency-alert-mistake\">and less reliable</a> local government alert systems for millions of people.</p>\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Los Angeles wildfires destroy thousands of structures, 10 deaths confirmed\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xE2sZSUsy4xblO661_t02hwoMvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25826110/2192573347.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo by Lokman Vural Elibol / Anadolu via Getty Images</cite>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"9soRIl\">An app born from fire</h3>\n<p id=\"a7arge\">The idea for Watch Duty <a href=\"https://www.kqed.org/news/12020980/what-is-watch-duty-and-how-does-the-app-track-wildfires\">came to cofounder John Mills</a> while he was trying to protect his off-grid Sonoma County home from the Walbridge fire in 2020. He realized there wasn’t a single source for all the information people needed to protect themselves from the blaze, which ultimately killed 33 people and destroyed 156 homes. John and his friend David Merritt, who is Watch Duty’s cofounder and CTO, decided to build an app to help.</p>\n<p id=\"sKEgDr\">“This came out of an idea that John had, and he talked to me about it four years ago,” Merritt tells <em>The Verge</em>. “We built the app in 60 days, and it was run completely by volunteers, no full-time staff. It was a side project for a lot of engineers, so the aim was to keep it as simple as possible.”</p>\n<p id=\"pmRiX2\">Fire reporting is piecemeal at best in fire-prone areas and frequently scattered across platforms like Facebook and X, where fire departments and counties have verified pages sharing relevant updates. But increasingly, social media platforms are putting automated access for alert services behind paywalls. Governments also use a wide variety of alert systems, causing delays that can cost lives, especially in fast-moving fires like the Palisades and Eaton fires that have forced evacuations for more than <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-09/la-s-100-000-evacuees-flee-fires-for-shelters-second-homes\">180,000 people</a>. And sometimes, these government-run <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24340289/los-angeles-wildfire-wireless-emergency-alert-mistake\">alerts are sent out mistakenly</a>, causing mass confusion. </p>\n<p id=\"migVAh\">Watch Duty simplifies all that for millions of people.</p>\n<p id=\"Z02wjN\">“We view what we are doing as a public service,” says Merritt. “It is a utility that everyone should have, which is timely, relevant information for their safety during emergencies. Right now, it’s very scattered. Even the agencies themselves, which have the best intentions, their hands are tied by bureaucracy or contracts. We partner with government sources with a focus on firefighting.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"x68p6Q\"><q>“We view what we are doing as a public service.”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"xxkTq1\">One of the biggest issues around fires, in particular, is that they can move quickly and consume large swaths of land and structures in minutes. For example, the winds that drove the Palisades fire to spread to more than 10,000 acres reached <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/01/08/what-caused-palisades-fire-california-windstorm-conditions/\">90 miles per hour on Tuesday</a>. When minutes matter, the piecemeal alert system that Watch Duty replaces can cause delays that cost lives. </p>\n<p id=\"hYmdMj\">“Some of the delivery systems for push notifications and text messages that government agencies use had a 15-minute delay, which is not good for fire,” says Merritt. “We shoot to have push notifications out in under a minute. Right now, 1.5 million people in LA are getting push notifications through the app. That’s a lot of messages to send out in 60 seconds. In general, people are getting it pretty much all at the same time.”</p>\n<div><div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/68715WyXO11x2iJau7GU1jKVD_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25826274/Watch_Duty___4_2x.png\">\n      <cite>Image: Watch Duty</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aekfOi0PEFEoow-zsndVZp_0D4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25826272/Watch_Duty___3.png\">\n      <cite>Image: Watch Duty</cite>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<h3 id=\"RIJht5\">A simple tech stack</h3>\n<p id=\"up6AqE\">For Watch Duty, this kind of mass communication requires reliable technology as well as a group of dedicated staff and skilled volunteers.

Merritt says the app uses some AI, but only for internal routing of alerts and emails. Reporters at Watch Duty — those who listen to scanners and update the app with push notifications about everything from air drops to evacuation updates — are mostly volunteers who coordinate coverage via Slack. </p>\n<p id=\"VfZpQe\">“All information is vetted for quality over quantity,” he says. “We have a code of conduct for reporters. For example, we never report on injuries or give specific addresses. It’s all tailored with a specific set of criteria. We don’t editorialize. We report on what we have heard on the scanners.” </p>\n<p id=\"d89qaL\">According to Merritt, the app has 100 percent uptime. Even though it started with volunteer engineers, the nonprofit has slowly added more full-time people. “We still have volunteers helping us, but it’s becoming more on the internal paid staff as we grow, as things get more complex, and as we have more rigorous processes,” he says.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"NyvDEK\"><q>“All information is vetted for quality over quantity.”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"xUYlvG\">He says there are no plans to ever charge for the app or scrape user data.

Just how imminent is anyone’s guess with the company stating that it would <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024\">reveal info on the console</a> before the end of its fiscal year in March. Rumors regarding the new Switch have been circulating for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news\">more than a year</a>, but with less than two months to go until the promised deadline, and in the absence of any real information from Nintendo itself, speculation about the console, its specs, physical profile, and more have reached a fever pitch. So before the official reveal, here’s everything we think we know about Nintendo’s next console.</p>\n<p id=\"ShHmhG\">The only concrete, Nintendo-confirmed piece of information we know about the new console is that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation\">it’ll be backwards compatible with the Switch</a>. Everything else has come by way of leaks and info supplied by third-party manufacturers. Late last year, one such manufacturer, Dbrand, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch\">debuted its Killswitch carrying case meant for the Switch 2</a>. According to Dbrand CEO Adam Ijaz, the Killswitch is based on the “actual dimensions” of the new console obtained from a “3D scan of the real hardware.” But in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, he declined to say exactly how or where Dbrand obtained such information.</p>\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A render of Dbrand’s Killswitch 2 case, with a mockup of the Nintendo Switch 2 inside it.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7E_0wVTs1O86WAmoR_AjYnoTKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25789051/killswitch_2_dbrand.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Dbrand</cite>\n      <figcaption>Dbrand’s render of its Killswitch 2 case.</figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"9Pm5HY\">If the Killswitch’s design is indeed derived from the real thing, the new console will be larger than the Switch OLED with an 8-inch screen, and feature a kickstand that will span the length of the console similar to the OLED model. That the new Switch will be larger than previous iterations is supported by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324483/nintendo-switch-2-leak-reddit-next-handheld\">leaks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339979/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-renders-onleaks\">info from other accessory manufacturers</a> as well as the idea that the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/26/24141744/is-nintendo-going-off-the-rails\">Joy-Con controllers will attach via magnet</a> instead of sliding and snapping into place. The new controller design will also incorporate magnets in the joysticks to combat against the dreaded “Joy-Con drift” that plagues the Switch even now.</p>\n<p id=\"dRjeZO\">CES 2025 provided even more fodder for the rumor mill, with accessory manufacturer Genki <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025\">showing off a 3D printed mock-up of the console</a> on the show floor. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Genki CEO Eddie Tsai went into detail about what he knows about the new Switch reaffirming rumors regarding its larger size, magnetic Joy-Con, and more.</p>\n<p id=\"v0EGdK\">While there’s a lot of speculation and potential evidence about what the new console will look like, there’s less circulating about what it can actually do. Beyond <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/1/24333491/new-year-new-alleged-switch-2-leak\">an alleged photo of the console’s motherboard</a>, there hasn’t been much out there about the console’s hardware specifications. Because Nintendo has never made consoles at the bleeding edge (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23420732/bayonetta-3-review-nintendo-switch\">or, honestly, even the cutting one</a>) of graphics or processing power, it’s hard to guess how well the console will perform or what additional features, like a microphone, it’ll have.</p>\n<p id=\"rhEyyw\">Though the console’s internals remain a mystery, we do know that it’ll be backwards compatible with Switch games. We can also reasonably guess at least one game that’ll be a launch title: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017\"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>.

But there are <a href=\"https://www.autofinancenews.net/allposts/risk-management/honda-nissan-deal-is-credit-positive-honda-faces-risks-moodys/\">huge risks</a> involved, too. </p>\n<p id=\"TKWA5c\">On Tuesday in Las Vegas, during a roundtable discussion with select media, Honda executives offered some more insight into the merger, including how combining resources and factories could help the companies stay competitive in the increasingly costly fight with China.</p>\n<p id=\"zZlJUs\">Honda is concerned about China’s meteoric rise as a dominant and highly competitive player in the EV and autonomous driving space. In late December, when Honda and Nissan announced that they had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/23/24327946/honda-nissan-mitsubishi-merger-deal-plans-2026\">signed a memorandum of understanding to create an automotive company worth around $50 billion,</a> <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/honda-nissan-set-announce-launch-integration-talks-media-reports-say-2024-12-22/\">Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said</a> that the “rise of Chinese automakers and new players has changed the car industry quite a lot... We have to build up capabilities to fight with them by 2030, otherwise we’ll be beaten.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"P4p7c2\"><q>Honda executives offered some more insight into the merger</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"jRKpp9\">The stakes are high, too. According to a recent report by <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/2025-auto-sales-forecast-global.html\">S&amp;P Global Mobility</a>, the global EV market will grow nearly 30 percent year over year, with 89.6 million new EVs expected to be sold this year. According to <a href=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/autonomous-vehicle-market\">Allied Market Research</a>, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach around $60.3 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $448.6 billion by 2035. If the Japanese automakers want to continue to dominate the market as they have since the 1960s, they have to iterate quickly and get products into consumers’ hands. </p>\n<p id=\"S7i4Vi\">“Since the beginning of last year, we’ve been in conversation with Nissan,” Noriya Kaihara, director and executive vice president at Honda, said through a translator following the company’s debut of two <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338134/honda-zero-saloon-suv-ev-asimo-os-ces\">“production prototypes,” the Honda 0 Saloon and the Honda 0 SUV at CES</a>. “Nothing has been decided but we’ve been discussing how to proceed.” </p>\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Honda 0 Saloon concept at CES 2025\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0fJ2xk42lzNsJG3VpLUEAE-uif0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25823526/DSC00200.jpg\">\n      <cite>Photo: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The Honda 0 Saloon at CES.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<h3 id=\"kdvOgk\">Honda wants Nissan’s large SUVs and underutilized factories</h3>\n<p id=\"o5XTGM\">During the roundtable, Kaihara said that Honda is looking at Nissan as a way to reduce costs around future software-defined vehicles (SDV). </p>\n<p id=\"WTW5U8\">“We have significant labor and development costs, and if there are operations we could share, that would be good for us,” he said. Developing brand-new software, he continued, including advanced driving systems that move closer to autonomous vehicles and battery-electric vehicles, is both increasingly important for the longevity of established automakers and increasingly expensive.  </p>\n<p id=\"ZJBSWX\">Honda also said that Nissan’s large SUVs like the Armada and Pathfinder make it an attractive partner. Toshihiro Akiwa, VP and head of Honda’s BEV development center, said through a translator that Honda’s hybrid technology is solid but only currently exists in its midsize vehicles like the CR-V and the Accord. The company is interested in Nissan’s larger vehicles because Honda’s “motor and battery capacity can be adapted to the larger vehicle.”</p>\n<div><div class=\"c-image-grid\">\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6O6orNjIHQXtG41KRCaVXHLVXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25824116/01_2024_Prologue_Elite.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Honda</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The Honda Prologue.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n<div class=\"c-image-grid__item\">\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGcmREZD2sR8bqw2mbDBI4OOTmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25824115/NISSAN_USA_SLT_0437.jpg\">\n      <cite>Image: Nissan</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The Nissan Armada.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<p id=\"yACZDU\">While Honda does have the Prologue, that vehicle was part of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/honda-shelves-plan-co-develop-smaller-evs-with-gm-bloomberg-news-2023-10-25/\">a $5 billion joint venture with GM</a> that only lasted through the development of two vehicles. The Prologue has been <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/746249/honda-prologue-2024-sales/\">a surprise EV hit</a>, selling over 33,000 in 2024 and outselling the larger gas-powered Honda Passport. </p>\n<p id=\"LoDU8z\">Since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/25/23931470/gm-honda-scrap-plan-build-cheaper-evs\">the partnership with GM went south</a>, it’s not likely that the Prologue will be in production long, though Honda has made no announcements about its plans for the vehicle. Honda does not currently offer an all-electric crossover outside of the Prologue, though fans of the brand have been asking for an all-electric CR-V for years. </p>\n<p id=\"jrrQih\">Nissan, on the other hand, saw its <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2024%2F11%2F07%2Fnissan-plans-9000-job-cuts-slashes-annual-profit-outlook-.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2025%2F1%2F11%2F24339888%2Fhonda-nissan-merge-china-ev-hybrid-suv-factory-ces\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">earnings decline by as much as 90 percent last year</a>, forcing it to lay off thousands of employees.

But there are huge risks involved, too. \nOn Tuesday in Las Vegas, during a roundtable discussion with select media, Honda executives offered some more insight into the merger, including how combining resources and factories could help the companies stay competitive in the increasingly costly fight with China.\nHonda is concerned about China’s meteoric rise as a dominant and highly competitive player in the EV and autonomous driving space. In late December, when Honda and Nissan announced that they had signed a memorandum of understanding to create an automotive company worth around $50 billion, Honda CEO Toshihiro Mibe said that the “rise of Chinese automakers and new players has changed the car industry quite a lot... We have to build up capabilities to fight with them by 2030, otherwise we’ll be beaten.”\nHonda executives offered some more insight into the merger\nThe stakes are high, too. According to a recent report by S&P Global Mobility, the global EV market will grow nearly 30 percent year over year, with 89.6 million new EVs expected to be sold this year. According to Allied Market Research, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach around $60.3 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $448.6 billion by 2035. If the Japanese automakers want to continue to dominate the market as they have since the 1960s, they have to iterate quickly and get products into consumers’ hands. \n“Since the beginning of last year, we’ve been in conversation with Nissan,” Noriya Kaihara, director and executive vice president at Honda, said through a translator following the company’s debut of two “production prototypes,” the Honda 0 Saloon and the Honda 0 SUV at CES. “Nothing has been decided but we’ve been discussing how to proceed.” \nPhoto: Vjeran Pavic / The Verge\n      The Honda 0 Saloon at CES.\n  \nHonda wants Nissan’s large SUVs and underutilized factories\nDuring the roundtable, Kaihara said that Honda is looking at Nissan as a way to reduce costs around future software-defined vehicles (SDV). \n“We have significant labor and development costs, and if there are operations we could share, that would be good for us,” he said. Developing brand-new software, he continued, including advanced driving systems that move closer to autonomous vehicles and battery-electric vehicles, is both increasingly important for the longevity of established automakers and increasingly expensive.  \nHonda also said that Nissan’s large SUVs like the Armada and Pathfinder make it an attractive partner. Toshihiro Akiwa, VP and head of Honda’s BEV development center, said through a translator that Honda’s hybrid technology is solid but only currently exists in its midsize vehicles like the CR-V and the Accord. The company is interested in Nissan’s larger vehicles because Honda’s “motor and battery capacity can be adapted to the larger vehicle.”\n\n\n\n        \n      Image: Honda\n      The Honda Prologue.\n  \n\n\n\n        \n      Image: Nissan\n      The Nissan Armada.\n  \n\n\nWhile Honda does have the Prologue, that vehicle was part of a $5 billion joint venture with GM that only lasted through the development of two vehicles. The Prologue has been a surprise EV hit, selling over 33,000 in 2024 and outselling the larger gas-powered Honda Passport. \nSince the partnership with GM went south, it’s not likely that the Prologue will be in production long, though Honda has made no announcements about its plans for the vehicle. Honda does not currently offer an all-electric crossover outside of the Prologue, though fans of the brand have been asking for an all-electric CR-V for years. \nNissan, on the other hand, saw its earnings decline by as much as 90 percent last year, forcing it to lay off thousands of employees. The company has been struggling since the arrest of former Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn in 2018 for financial misconduct. Unsurprisingly, Ghosn isn’t pleased about the news, telling Bloomberg that Nissan was in “panic mode,” calling the deal a “desperate move” and noting that the “synergies between the two companies are difficult to find.”\nBut as Honda executives at the roundtable noted, Nissan’s struggle could pose an opportunity for Honda, too. That’s because Honda plants that serve the US are currently running at maximum capacity, and they could use the excess capacity at Nissan’s factories to meet customer demand. “I’m not in a position to make comment [on Nissan], but they have capacity,” Kaihara said.\nPhoto by PETER POWER / AFP via Getty Images\n      Honda’s factory in Ontario, Canada.\n  \nTrump’s tariff threats and loss of EV incentives\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s threats to impose tariffs on foreign imports and eliminate federal subsidies that have helped save Americans billions in EV costs also came up in the conversation. “If Trump impacts future government strategy we have to be very flexible when the subsidies are cut or stopped,” Kaihara said. \nThat includes where Honda builds and produces its most popular vehicles like the CR-V and Civic. “Each factory in Canada and Mexico is almost to full production level,” Kaihara said. “It’s not so easy to change that direction, but depending on the tariff situation, we might have to change the production location to Japan or somewhere else.”  \nA significant move like that would be costly and could translate to increased prices for consumers when they go to buy their next Honda.  \nIn spite of all this, Honda is not wavering on its commitment to electrification. “For the time being, we will have new EVs in the next year for the Zero series,” Kaihara said. “For the long term, I think, considering the environmental issues, EVs will be the solution for the future, and that will not be changed.”","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24339888/honda-nissan-merge-china-ev-hybrid-suv-factory-ces","isoDate":"2025-01-11T14:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"Coming back to CES after a decade-long break was a trip","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24340285/ces-2025-robots-ai-sphere","pubDate":"2025-01-11T13:00:00.000Z","author":"Allison Johnson","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Photo of a smartphone taking a picture of transparent display panels.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3DI0Qd3qsBCvAkAOshUMVYOc5wM=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73840253/dsc08924_processed.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>Cool screens are still undefeated at CES.</em></figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p class=\"p--has-dropcap\" id=\"UVIgEZ\">Twelve years ago, I could have told you exactly what happened at my first CES and what happened at my third.

When Zuckerberg isn’t outright lying about any of this, he’s quite vague — but in case you were wondering, a man who was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/general-news-6bafe23177047b052c345a388ef322d3\">formally rebuked by the city of San Francisco</a> for putting his name on a hospital while his platforms spread health misinformation thinks that “on balance, the vaccines are more positive than negative.” Whew!</p>\n<p id=\"NgMQlI\">Misinformation on Facebook started well before the 2016 election — as early as 2014, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/22/7028983/fake-news-sites-are-using-facebook-to-spread-ebola-panic\">scammers were spreading Ebola lies on Facebook</a>. Shortly after the 2016 election, Adam Mosseri — then Facebook’s VP of product management — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13586862/facebook-fake-news-statement-trump\">said in a statement</a> that Facebook was combating fake news but “there’s so much more we need to do.” Facebook did receive criticism for spreading fake news, including misinformation that benefitted President Donald Trump, but even then, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/10/13594558/mark-zuckerberg-election-fake-news-trump\">Zuckerberg wasn’t having it. </a>“I do think there is a certain profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason someone could have voted the way they did is they saw some fake news,” Zuckerberg said. </p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"vgarJQ\"><q>“It’s something out of like <em>1984.</em>”</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"hO3urs\">Still, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation\">in the 2020 election, Facebook </a>— along with other social media networks — took a harsher stance on fake news, making it harder for <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo\">Macedonian teenagers</a> to make a profit off Trump supporters. During his Rogan interview, Zuckerberg now characterizes this intervention as giving “too much deference to a lot of folks in the media who were basically saying, okay, there’s no way that this guy could have gotten elected except for misinformation.”</p>\n<p id=\"8DxTb1\">Facebook implemented <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/formedia/mjp/programs/third-party-fact-checking/partner-map\">a fact-checking program</a>, one that involved partners such as the conservative online magazine <em>The Dispatch</em>, Reuters, Agence France-Presse and USA Today. In a concession to Donald Trump’s second presidency, implemented before Trump even took the oath of office, Zuckerberg has said Facebook will end the program. “We’re going to get back to our roots and focus on reducing mistakes, simplifying our policies and restoring free expression on our platforms,” Zuckerberg said in the video announcing the move.</p>\n<p id=\"32DlbY\">On the Rogan show, Zuckerberg went further in describing the fact-checking program he’d implemented: “It’s something out of like <em>1984.</em>” He says the fact-checkers were “too biased,” though he doesn’t say exactly how.</p>\n<p id=\"U0tRlw\">The problem wasn’t that the fact-checking was bad; it was that conservatives are more likely to share misinformation and get fact-checked, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07942-8\">as some research has shown</a>. That means conservatives are also more likely to be moderated. In this sense, perhaps it wasn’t Facebook’s fact-checking systems that had a liberal bias, but <em>reality</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"SgCv1A\"><q>The biggest lie of all is a lie of omission</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"JFJonU\">Well, Zuckerberg’s out of the business of reality now. I am sympathetic to the difficulties social media platforms faced in trying to moderate during covid — where rapidly-changing information about the pandemic was difficult to keep up with and conspiracy theories ran amok. I’m just not convinced it happened the way Zuckerberg describes. Zuckerberg whines about being pushed by the Biden administration to fact-check claims: “These people from the Biden administration would call up our team, and, like, scream at them, and curse,” Zuckerberg says. </p>\n<p id=\"coJwlI\">“Did you record any of these phone calls?” Rogan asks.</p>\n<p id=\"5lgBE6\">“I don’t know,” Zuckerberg says. “I don’t think we were.”</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"4jTBOD\"><q>Many of the controversial moderation calls Facebook made in the pandemic were during the Trump administration</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"m8CR0E\">Rogan then asks who, specifically, was pressuring Facebook. And Zuckerberg has no answer: “It was people in the Biden administration,” he says. “I think it was, you know, I wasn’t involved in those conversations directly, but I think it was.”</p>\n<p id=\"mXM9fm\">But the biggest lie of all is a lie of omission: Zuckerberg doesn’t mention the relentless pressure conservatives have placed on the company for years  — which has now clearly paid off. Zuckerberg is particularly full of shit here because <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24146357/republicans-internal-emails-texts-tech-executives-meta-facebook-white-house\">Republican Rep. Jim Jordan released Zuckerberg’s internal communications</a> which document this!</p>\n<p id=\"KnXiww\">In his letter to Jordan’s committee, Zuckerberg writes, “<em>Ultimately it was our decision whether or not to take content down</em>.” Emphasis mine. “Like I said to our teams at the time, I feel strongly that we should not compromise our content standards due to pressure from any Administration in either direction – and we’re ready to push back if something like this happens again.”</p>\n<p id=\"hUghSn\">Those emails also reveal Zuckerberg wanted to blame the Biden White House for how Facebook chose to moderate the “lab leak” conspiracy theory of covid origins. “Can we include that the WH put pressure on us to censor the lab leak theory?” he asked in a WhatsApp chat. His former president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, responded, “I don’t think they put specific pressure on that theory.”</p>\n<p id=\"PGIZQt\">Joel Kaplan, the former George W. Bush advisor who has now replaced Clegg, said that blaming the White House for Facebook’s behavior would “supercharge” conservatives who believed the social media giant was “collaborating” with the Biden administration. “If they’re more interested in criticizing us than actually solving the problems, then I’m not sure how it’s helping the cause to engage with them further,” Zuckerberg wrote. This doesn’t seem to show that the Biden administration successfully censored anything.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"R5gtyo\"><q>Facebook was widely and obviously targeted by Republican lawmakers</q></aside></div>\n<p id=\"vVlzL4\">In fact, many of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21254960/facebook-ai-moderation-covid-19-coronavirus-hateful-memes-hate-speech\">controversial moderation calls</a> Facebook made in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/18/21183549/coronavirus-content-moderators-facebook-google-twitter\">the pandemic</a> were <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/21/21228223/facebook-pandemic-covid-relief-symptom-tracker-mark-zuckerberg-stay-at-home-protests\">during the <em>Trump</em> administration</a>. Take, for instance,<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21254184/how-plandemic-went-viral-facebook-youtube\"> the “Plandemic” video hoax</a>: Facebook removed the video in 2020. Joe Biden took office in 2021. If Zuckerberg was dealing with an administration pressuring him about this, <em>it was the Trump administration. </em>The Biden White House may well have engaged in similar outreach, but it was joining what was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/c/21444203/facebook-leaked-audio-zuckerberg-trump-pandemic-blm\">already an active discussion about Facebook moderation</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"XE1fMG\">Facebook was widely and obviously targeted by Republican lawmakers, including Jordan, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18305268/republicans-facebook-twitter-concerns-conservative-bias-ted-cruz\">Senator Ted Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump\">Florida governor Ron DeSantis,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652764/facebook-twitter-censor-ban-texas-republicans-abbott\">Texas governor Greg Abbott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/blackburn-letter-biden-facebook-censorship-first-amendment-violation\">Senator Marsha Blackburn</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24259972/vance-walz-big-tech-first-amendment-debate\">incoming Vice President JD Vance</a>. It was mostly conservatives who threatened him during the<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21539458/senate-committee-hearing-section-230-republicans-twitter-facebook\"> interminable and pointless</a> Congressional hearings Zuckerberg sat through for years – often asking him to comment directly on conspiracy theories or demand that individual trolls be reinstated to his platforms.</p>\n<p id=\"37tPSD\">But Zuckerberg didn’t mention any of that to Rogan. Instead, he was upset that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau started <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/10/31/meta-cfpb-investigation-financial-data-ads/\">investigating him for improperly using financial information to target ads</a>. What does Zuckerberg say about this? Well, let me give it to you straight: </p>\n<blockquote><p id=\"DlnejN\">They kind of found some theory they wanted to investigate. And it’s like, okay, clearly they were trying really hard, right? To like, to like, find, find some theory, but it, like, I don’t know.

I mean, I’ve never been in government. I don’t know if it’s like a directive or it’s just like a quiet consensus that like, we don’t like these guys. They’re not doing what we want. We’re going to punish them. But, but it’s, it’s, it’s tough to be at the other end of that.</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"LuoO1r\">This is a compelling demonstration that jujitsu and MMA training (or hunting pigs in Hawaii or making your neck real thick or whatever) isn’t going to help you act aggressive if you’re constitutionally bitchmade. Blaming the CFPB for a witch-hunt when we’ve all watched <em>Republicans</em> target Facebook really is something! That’s what this whole performance is about: getting Trump, Vance, Jordan and the rest of the Republican party to lay off. After all, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion\">Cambridge Analytica scandal cost Facebook just $5 billion</a> — chump change, really. If Zuckerberg plays ball, his next privacy whoopsie could be even cheaper.</p>\n<p id=\"xFA3lx\">In fact, Zuckerberg even offers Republicans another target: Apple. According to Zuckerberg, the way Apple makes money is “by basically, like, squeezing people.” Among his complaints: </p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"aqyHvZ\">Apple’s 30 percent commission on App Store sales </li>\n<li id=\"5LlhEw\">Airpods work better with Apple phones than all other headphones</li>\n<li id=\"e6MCa1\">Apple wouldn’t let Zuckerberg’s Meta Ray-Bans connect to iOS using the same quick-setup protocol Airpods use</li>\n<li id=\"7wQd8L\"> iMessage is a walled garden, and groupchats go wonky if there’s a person with an Android phone in there</li>\n<li id=\"7Ri405\">“I mean at some point I did this like back of the envelope calculation of like all the random rules that Apple puts out.

But that isn’t what’s on Zuckerberg’s mind. The last point is the important one, from his perspective.

Personally, I’d call it “creep shit.” \nIf you can get away with the small bullshit, you can get away with the big bullshit, right?\nEarly on in the interview, Zuckerberg tests out the water to see how much pushback he’ll get; Rogan is a notoriously soft interviewer — it’s like listening to your dumbest stoned friend hold a conversation — but he does occasionally challenge his guests. So Zuckerberg says that there are limits on the First Amendment by saying, “It’s like, all right, you can’t yell fire in a crowded theater.”\n“Fire in a crowded theater” makes every lawyer I know foam at the mouth because it’s flat out wrong. It is not the law, and it never has been. And, obviously, you can yell “fire” in a crowded theater — especially if, you know, the theater is on fire. Rogan says nothing in response to this, and Zuckerberg knows he’s got a willing mark. If you can get away with the small bullshit, you can get away with the big bullshit, right?\nFor his part, Rogan serves up Zuckerberg a series of softballs, setting his own tone by referring to content moderation as “censorship.” The idea that the government was forcing Zuckerberg to “censor” news about covid and covid vaccines, Hunter Biden’s laptop, and the election is something of a running theme throughout the interview.
