In a way, they are a new type of AI PC architecture specifically built for running neural networks, and five major PC manufacturers will build them.\nThese desktop systems, first previewed as \"Project DIGITS\" in January, aim to bring AI capabilities to developers, researchers, and data scientists who need to prototype, fine-tune, and run large AI models locally. DGX systems can serve as standalone desktop AI labs or \"bridge systems\" that allow AI developers to move their models from desktops to DGX Cloud or any AI cloud infrastructure with few code changes.\nHuang explained the rationale behind these new products in a news release, saying, \"AI has transformed every layer of the computing stack. It stands to reason a new class of computers would emerge—designed for AI-native developers and to run AI-native applications.\"\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Benj Edwards\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-dgx-desktop-personal-ai-supercomputers/#comments","content":"\n            Asus, Dell, HP, and others to produce powerful desktop machines that run AI models locally.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Asus, Dell, HP, and others to produce powerful desktop machines that run AI models locally.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/nvidia-announces-dgx-desktop-personal-ai-supercomputers/","categories":["AI","Biz & IT","Tech","AI GPU","ASUS","dell","desktop AI PC","desktop PC","DGX","DGX Spark","DGX Station","GPUs","HP","Jensen Huang","Lenovo","machine learning","NVIDIA","Nvidia DGX","Nvidia GTC","personal AI supercomputer","supermicro"],"isoDate":"2025-03-18T21:19:53.000Z"}],"feedUrl":"https://arstechnica.com/feed/","image":{"link":"https://arstechnica.com","url":"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/cropped-ars-logo-512_480-60x60.png","title":"Ars Technica","width":"32","height":"32"},"paginationLinks":{"self":"https://arstechnica.com/feed/"},"title":"Ars Technica - All content","description":"All Ars Technica stories","link":"https://arstechnica.com","language":"en-US","lastBuildDate":"Thu, 20 Mar 2025 04:11:31 +0000"}
