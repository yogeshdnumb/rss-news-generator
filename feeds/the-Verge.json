It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing.

That being said, it’s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHYQ1VJ/\">Amazon</a> right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $299.99 ($100 off), which is an all-time low.

It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.</p>\n\n<p>The Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch.

Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost.

The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.</p>\n\n<p>In recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHZ13GG/\">with a Trail Loop</a> starting at $734.89 (about $64 off), or with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHNX1SH/\">an Alpine Loop</a> or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHRFYMM/\">an Ocean Band</a> starting at $741.89 (about $57 off).

These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"The Series 10 isn’t a huge departure from the Series 9, but the larger wide-angle OLED display is certainly welcome. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n\nIn September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2.

If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale at Walmart starting at $229 ($100 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing at Walmart and Amazon starting at $249 ($50 off).\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon with a Trail Loop starting at $734.89 (about $64 off), or with an Alpine Loop or an Ocean Band starting at $741.89 (about $57 off). You can also pick it up at Best Buy and Target starting at around $799, which is the standard retail price.\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.","summary":"In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals","isoDate":"2025-03-17T23:19:26.000Z"},{"title":"CFPB workers are reinstated after a court order, but many still can’t work","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/631465/cfpb-probationary-employees-court-order-reinstatement","pubDate":"2025-03-17T22:41:49.000Z","author":"Lauren Feiner","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/STKS499_CFPB_A.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Terminated employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) have been brought back to work in response to a judge’s order — sort of.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Probationary employees (a class of government workers who are newer to an agency or role) received letters over the weekend notifying them that they were reinstated into their positions, <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69714275/44/state-of-maryland-v-united-states-department-of-agriculture/\">following a court order</a> requiring the CFPB and 17 other agencies to restore such employees.
