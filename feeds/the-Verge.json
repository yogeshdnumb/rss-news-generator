And we’ve got the hands-on experience and pictures to prove it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apple’s got five main updates for its refresh of the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Airs for 2025. First, it’s got a similar M4 chip to the base 14-inch MacBook Pro, though here it starts with a 10-core CPU and 8-core GPU. Also inherited from the MacBook Pros, the Airs now use the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam that’s wider and can track you within the frame. And you can now (finally) use two external monitors and keep the lid open, essentially giving you a fancy triple-monitor setup with the lowly MacBook Air.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for that new color option, sky blue, it replaces space gray. Starlight, silver, and midnight are still around from last year (and midnight is unchanged, so expect some fingerprint smudginess). The new blue is a very pale metallic finish. You could mistake it for a silver if you didn’t see them side-by-side. I think the best way I could describe it is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tfedhwbe_1A?si=3OB6b9IzyNACM-5s&amp;t=29\">2003 Toyota Matrix blue</a>. In other words, it’s nice but not blue enough. Apple should call it non-committal blue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the fifth thing that’s new for the MacBook Air, and likely the one many of us will care most about, is that it starts at a lower price. The 13-inch model starts at $999 while the 15-inch starts at $1,199. This is actually a return to form for the 13-inch, which used to start at that price before <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23739220/apple-macbook-air-15-features-specs-price-release-date-wwdc-2023#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20Apple%20is%20updating%20the%20price%20on%20its%20smaller%20model.%20The%2013%2Dinch%20MacBook%20Air%20with%20M2%20now%20starts%20at%20%241%2C099%2C%20and%20the%20base%20M1%20Air%20remains%20%24999.\">an increase during the M2 generation</a>. The M4 Air may be an otherwise subtle chip-bump of an upgrade with a new bland-ish metallic finish, but $100 off makes all the difference.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to our hands-on with the MacBook Air we also got our first look at the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/624193/apple-mac-studio-m4-max-m3-ultra-launch-price-specs-availability\">new Mac Studio duo</a>, one with the M4 Max chip and one with a new, all-out M3 Ultra.

The device began shipping in February 2022, starting at $399.\nWith an unprecedented degree of support from Valve and the help of the gaming community, it progressed from being a “glorious mess” in our initial review to becoming one of The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2022 and something other companies couldn’t really match. More than two years after the Steam Deck launched, the landscape is very different now that new competition has arrived in the form of Windows-powered handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and Ayaneo’s assorted decks.\nNow Valve’s new revision of the Steam Deck adds an OLED screen along with tons of other improvements that Sean Hollister says make it “everything the original

Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>In case you missed it, Amazon<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271197/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-e-reader-12th-gen-2024\"> announced a new entry-level Kindle</a> in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23409106/amazon-kindle-2022-e-reader-review-test-price-specs-features\">2022 model</a>. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the Kindle at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CNV9F72P\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/kkarvxh95krvk\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/amazon-kindle-6-e-reader-2024/-/A-93604795?preselect=91563144#lnk=sametab\">Target</a> for its full retail price of $109.99.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Hgsv5D\">The best Kindle Kids (2024) deals</h2>\n\n<p>Amazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the&nbsp;<em>Percy Jackson</em> and&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>&nbsp;series — at no additional cost.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, we’ve seen the new Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off).

Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. That being said, it’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.</p>\n\n<p>Like other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations. There’s an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature/dp/B0C8RR4WN3/\">ad-free Signature Edition</a> for $199.99, which is identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. There’s also a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Kids-thousands-worry-free/dp/B0BL8S6ZPT\">Paperwhite Kids for $179.99</a>, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, we’ve seen the Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99.

You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n \n\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price.\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?\nAmazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\nIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $109.99. \nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the new Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only buy the e-reader at its full price of $129.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. That being said, it’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\nLike other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations. There’s an ad-free Signature Edition for $199.99, which is identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. There’s also a Paperwhite Kids for $179.99, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Unfortunately, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can also grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and a black, green, or pink fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off) or with a plant-based black, green, or pink leather cover for $202.97 ($20 off).\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.\nAs for the ad-free Signature Edition, it’s available at Amazon and Best Buy right now for $199.99 — its regular retail price.

communication\n\t\t\t\nAntarctic research is at risk.\n\t\t\t\nWe finally know who’s legally running DOGE\n\t\t\t\nDonald Trump broke the law by removing climate change references from USDA websites,
