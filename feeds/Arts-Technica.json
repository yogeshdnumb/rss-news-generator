Alexander Hartmann, a statistical physicist at the University of Oldenburg in Germany, had an intriguing insight when this happened while he was trying to solve a puzzle one day. According to <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.110.064138\">his paper</a> published in the journal Physical Review E, the crossword puzzle-solving process resembles a type of phase transition known as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-767WnbaCQ\">percolation</a>—one that seems to be unique compared to standard percolation models.</p>\n<p>Traditional mathematical models of percolation date back to the 1940s. Directed percolation is when the flow occurs in a specific direction, akin to how water moves through freshly ground coffee beans, flowing down in the direction of gravity.
