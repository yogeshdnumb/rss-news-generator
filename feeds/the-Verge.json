Meta isn’t worried, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That was CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s message to investors during his company’s <a href=\"https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx\">fourth-quarter earnings call</a> on Wednesday. During the Q&amp;A portion of the call with Wall Street analysts, Zuckerberg fielded multiple questions about DeepSeek’s impressive AI models and what the implications are for Meta’s AI strategy. He said that what DeepSeek was able to accomplish with relatively little money has “only strengthened our conviction that this is the right thing to be focused on.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Zuckerberg noted that “there’s a number of novel things they did we’re still digesting” and that Meta plans to implement DeepSeek’s “advancements” into Llama. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24353060/deepseek-ai-china-nvidia-openai\">DeepSeek caused a massive sell-off in AI stocks</a> due to fears that models will no longer need as much computing power. Zuckerberg tried to dispel concerns that the billions of dollars he’s spending on GPUs will go to waste: “I continue to think that investing very heavily in CapEx and infra is going to be a strategic advantage over time.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His argument is in line <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/22/24303470/ai-model-llm-progress-hitting-scaling-wall\">with the growing consensus</a> that computing resources will move from the training phase of AI development towards helping models better “reason.” In Zuckerberg’s own words, this “doesn’t mean you need less compute” because you can “apply more compute at inference time in order to generate a higher level of intelligence and a higher quality of service.” Meta is gearing up to release Llama 4 with multimodal and “agentic” capabilities in the coming months, according to Zuckerberg. He expects Meta’s AI assistant to reach one billion users this year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">He also took a thinly veiled jab at OpenAI, Anthropic, and other unprofitable startups by noting that Meta has a “strong business model” to support the roughly $60 billion it will spend on AI this year versus “others who don&#8217;t necessarily have business models to support it on a sustainable basis.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Zuckerberg also made sure to praise President Donald Trump. “We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning,” and “will defend our values and interests abroad,” he said. Moments before the earnings call started, news broke that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/602577/meta-trump-facebook-lawsuit-settlement\">Meta is paying Trump $25 million to settle a lawsuit</a> he brought against the company for banning his account after the January 6th insurrection. (The vast majority of the money is going to pay for Trump’s presidential library.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Meta is a cash-printing machine.

Meta isn’t worried, though.\nThat was CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s message to investors during his company’s fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. During the Q&A portion of the call with Wall Street analysts, Zuckerberg fielded multiple questions about DeepSeek’s impressive AI models and what the implications are for Meta’s AI strategy. He said that what DeepSeek was able to accomplish with relatively little money has “only strengthened our conviction that this is the right thing to be focused on.”\nZuckerberg noted that “there’s a number of novel things they did we’re still digesting” and that Meta plans to implement DeepSeek’s “advancements” into Llama. DeepSeek caused a massive sell-off in AI stocks due to fears that models will no longer need as much computing power. Zuckerberg tried to dispel concerns that the billions of dollars he’s spending on GPUs will go to waste: “I continue to think that investing very heavily in CapEx and infra is going to be a strategic advantage over time.”\nHis argument is in line with the growing consensus that computing resources will move from the training phase of AI development towards helping models better “reason.” In Zuckerberg’s own words, this “doesn’t mean you need less compute” because you can “apply more compute at inference time in order to generate a higher level of intelligence and a higher quality of service.” Meta is gearing up to release Llama 4 with multimodal and “agentic” capabilities in the coming months, according to Zuckerberg. He expects Meta’s AI assistant to reach one billion users this year.\nHe also took a thinly veiled jab at OpenAI, Anthropic, and other unprofitable startups by noting that Meta has a “strong business model” to support the roughly $60 billion it will spend on AI this year versus “others who don’t necessarily have business models to support it on a sustainable basis.”\nZuckerberg also made sure to praise President Donald Trump. “We now have a US administration that is proud of our leading companies, prioritizes American technology winning,” and “will defend our values and interests abroad,” he said.

Image: Umar Shakir / The Verge\n\nThe state of electric vehicle charging in North America is shaping up like the smartphone charging wars — but focused on much more expensive hardware. Right now, like USB-C and Android phones, the Combined Charging System (CCS, Type 1) plug is on a greater variety of cars. Meanwhile, Tesla’s plug was long compared to Apple and Lightning.\nBut while Apple eventually adopted USB-C, Tesla is opening up its connector, renaming it the North American Charging Standard (NACS), and trying to shove CCS out of the way.\nAnd it’s working: the new NACS port is being standardized by SAE International, and today, largely every automaker, including Ford, GM, Toyota, Rivian, Volvo, Polestar, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover, Fisker, Hyundai, Stellantis, Volkswagen, and BMW, has signed on. New cars equipped with NACS are on the way but likely won’t start rolling out until 2026.\nMeanwhile, Europe already dealt with its standards issue by settling on CCS2. For now, EV drivers in their Tesla Model Ys, Kia EV6s, and Nissan Leafs (with the ailing CHAdeMO connector) in the US are still stuck looking for the right station or adapter and hoping everything’s operational — but things should get easier soon.\nTo help solve these issues, the federal government has established a pool of $7.5 billion to fund charging network operators in building reliable EV infrastructure.\nNorth America can become a great and convenient place to own an electric vehicle, but how long will that take?
