We have a pretty good idea of what’s coming after months of leaks and rumors, so here’s everything we expect to see next week.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There won’t be a home button…</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest change is that Apple is upending the iPhone SE’s design, after leaving it broadly unchanged since the series’ inception in 2016. The 2022 SE is the last iPhone still using a home button, with a thick bezel around the top and bottom of the screen. But rumors say Apple will now ditch the button, slim the bezel, and add Face ID.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The result will be a phone that looks like the iPhone 14 from the front. Like that phone, it’s expected to place its Face ID sensors in a notch, rather than using the less obtrusive Dynamic Island design that was introduced in the 14 Pro and has been used in every iPhone since then. Apple can’t resist keeping its SE series just a little behind the times.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We’ve seen the notched design in a video <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24352767/iphone-se-4-leak-photos-videos-dummy-notch-dynamic-island-camera\">shared by the leaker Majin Bu</a>, which shows them handling what is likely a non-functional dummy unit, used by case manufacturers to design and test their accessories.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Here&#039;s what the iPhone SE 4 looks like <a href=\"https://t.co/pEyIAJ34VR\">pic.twitter.com/pEyIAJ34VR</a></p>&mdash; Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1883269912266944850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2025</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">…but there will be an Action button</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Bu’s video suggests that the SE 4 will include a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23889013/iphone-15-pro-action-button-programmability-possibility-powerful\">customizable Action button</a>, but not the Camera Control introduced on the iPhone 16. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Like other SE models it appears to stick to a single rear camera. One leaked spec list suggests that the SE will use a 48 megapixel sensor on the rear, with a 12 megapixel selfie camera on the front, but this is an area where there have been few reports so far. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">It’s not going to be a small phone</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The redesign will allow the 2025 SE to have a larger screen than the 4.7-inch panel used by the 2022 model. It’s expected to instead use a 6.1-inch display, the same size as the standard iPhone 16, and will also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234749/apple-iphone-se-4th-generation-oled-display-rumor-leak\">upgrade to OLED</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bigger screen means the phone as a whole will be larger than any previous iPhone SE, and there will no longer be any iPhone smaller than the standard model. If we assume the new phone will have similar dimensions to the iPhone 16 then it could be 9mm taller than the 2022 SE, and weigh about 25g more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Lightning is out, USB-C is in</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s pretty much certain that the phone will have a USB-C port rather than Lightning, allowing it to once again be sold in the EU.

We have a pretty good idea of what’s coming after months of leaks and rumors, so here’s everything we expect to see next week.\nThere won’t be a home button…\nThe biggest change is that Apple is upending the iPhone SE’s design, after leaving it broadly unchanged since the series’ inception in 2016. The 2022 SE is the last iPhone still using a home button, with a thick bezel around the top and bottom of the screen. But rumors say Apple will now ditch the button, slim the bezel, and add Face ID.\nThe result will be a phone that looks like the iPhone 14 from the front. Like that phone, it’s expected to place its Face ID sensors in a notch, rather than using the less obtrusive Dynamic Island design that was introduced in the 14 Pro and has been used in every iPhone since then. Apple can’t resist keeping its SE series just a little behind the times.\nWe’ve seen the notched design in a video shared by the leaker Majin Bu, which shows them handling what is likely a non-functional dummy unit, used by case manufacturers to design and test their accessories.\n\n\nHere's what the iPhone SE 4 looks like pic.twitter.com/pEyIAJ34VR\n— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) January 25, 2025\n\n\n…but there will be an Action button\nBu’s video suggests that the SE 4 will include a customizable Action button, but not the Camera Control introduced on the iPhone 16. \nLike other SE models it appears to stick to a single rear camera. One leaked spec list suggests that the SE will use a 48 megapixel sensor on the rear, with a 12 megapixel selfie camera on the front, but this is an area where there have been few reports so far. \nIt’s not going to be a small phone\nThe redesign will allow the 2025 SE to have a larger screen than the 4.7-inch panel used by the 2022 model. It’s expected to instead use a 6.1-inch display, the same size as the standard iPhone 16, and will also upgrade to OLED. \nThe bigger screen means the phone as a whole will be larger than any previous iPhone SE, and there will no longer be any iPhone smaller than the standard model. If we assume the new phone will have similar dimensions to the iPhone 16 then it could be 9mm taller than the 2022 SE, and weigh about 25g more.\nLightning is out, USB-C is in\nIt’s pretty much certain that the phone will have a USB-C port rather than Lightning, allowing it to once again be sold in the EU. The previous SE model was discontinued in EU markets along with every other iPhone using a Lightning port.\n\n\niPhone SE 4 looks so beautiful pic.twitter.com/ezhNrrhyf8\n— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) January 26, 2025\n\n\nIt’ll be one of the most powerful iPhones around\nOn the inside, Bloomberg reports that the phone will use the same A18 chip as the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro models.
