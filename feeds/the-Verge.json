Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C.

The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the sometimes finicky tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23187234/bowers-wilkins-px7-s2-noise-canceling-headphones-review\">Read our review</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The <strong>Beats Solo 4 </strong>have returned to $129.95 ($70 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Ear-Headphones-Compatible/dp/B0CZPLV566/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amazon</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howl.link/p9i6lcfgde2eq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Best Buy</a>, which represents their second-best price to date. It’s a shame they lack noise cancellation, but the headphones still offer good value with bass-rich sound as well as features like spatial audio and lossless playback over USB-C (or 3.5mm).

It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst <em>Verge </em>staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the <strong>ChomChom Roller</strong>, especially since it&#8217;s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BAGTNAQ\">Amazon</a> for $19.59 ($5 off).

The company’s <strong>Drill Tool Set</strong> — which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YTNLDJG\">Amazon</a> for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Having access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed.

So, scroll down to find steep savings on video doorbells, headphones, smartwatches, air purifiers, and loads of other tech while you can.\nWhile having a Prime subscription means your packages will certainly arrive more quickly, you don’t necessarily need to be a member to get in on these tried-and-tested Verge favorites (only in rare cases are deals exclusive to Prime members, and we’ll note when that’s the case). We’ll also be keeping an eye on deals at competing retailers, including Best Buy, Walmart, and Target.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured deals\nRobot vacuum deals\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nPortable charger and cable deals\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nSmart home deals\nTablet and e-reader deals\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nOther Verge favorites\n\nFeatured deals\nRobot vacuum deals\nThe Dreame L20 Ultra is on sale for a new low of $549.99 ($450 off) at Amazon. It lacks the self-retracting arms found on the newer, more powerful X40, but otherwise it’s a great cleaning machine. The dual mop pads can still extend to clean baseboard and corners, while its 7,000Pa of suction power does a good job of sucking up unwanted dirt and debris. The robovac is also capable of emptying its own dust bin and water tanks (as well as refilling them), in addition to washing and drying its own mop pads.\nVerge smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy recommends the Roborock Q5 Pro for those who want a budget-friendly robot vacuum that’s skilled in the arcane art of sucking up pet hair. Fortunately, the Q5 Pro Plus model is on sale at Amazon with its auto-empty bin for just $299.99 ($400 off) — a $70 upcharge on the standard Q50 Pro that’s well worth it if your space has a lot of fur to sweep up.\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nThe Beats Studio Pro are on sale at Amazon and Walmart for $179.95 ($170 off), which remains one of the best prices we’ve seen. Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C. Plus, unlike most noise-canceling headphones, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. Read our review.\nThe Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e — aka, the best-sounding wireless headphones you can buy — are available at Amazon starting at $295.60 (about $103 off), or from Bower & Wilkins or Best Buy for $319 ($80 off). The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the sometimes finicky tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5. Read our review.\nThe Beats Solo 4 have returned to $129.95 ($70 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which represents their second-best price to date. It’s a shame they lack noise cancellation, but the headphones still offer good value with bass-rich sound as well as features like spatial audio and lossless playback over USB-C (or 3.5mm). They also offer native support for both iOS and Android, making them a good buy if you want some platform flexibility. Read our review.\nAnker’s Soundcore Sport X20 earbuds are on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $63.99 ($16 off), matching their second-best price to date. The fitness-friendly buds are a lot like the Sport X10 — which were once our favorite budget earbuds for the gym — only they offer longer battery life, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and multipoint support. They also supposedly offer better noise cancellation and continue to sport an adjustable ear hook, which is a boon if you’re someone who struggles with keeping traditional earbuds in during intense gym sessions.\nPortable charger and cable deals\nPower banks with built-in USB-C cables are the hot thing right now. As it turns out, having a battery pack that can charge your device in a jiffy and double as a lanyard is pretty great. Luckily, you can snag one of the most affordable 20,000mAh models out there, Anker’s 30W Zolo power bank, for $24.61 (about $11 off) at Amazon. While it’s not powerful enough to quickly charge a Steam Deck that’s running games, it’ll do just fine for charging it (as well as other USB-C devices) while they sleep.\nIf you’re someone who owns (or, someday, envisions owning) USB-C gadgets that draw a lot of power, it’s wise to buy cables with high wattage passthrough, just so you’re ready for the future. Anker’s six-foot 240W USB-C cable is a great candidate, especially since it’s discounted to $16.99 ($8 off) at Amazon.\nUgreen’s Uno lineup of charging accessories aims to be more personable. To that end, its 6.6-foot 1ooW USB-C cable — which is currently discounted to $10.39 ($2.61 off) at Amazon — has expressive, Tamagotchi-like eyes. The reason? There’s no reason — it’s just cute, okay?\nIf you’re not ready to pony up for a Qi2 charger, Ugreen’s Magnetic Wireless Charging Station has fallen to an all-time low of $21.99 ($14 off) at Amazon. Unlike the newer Qi2 offerings that provide 15W charging speeds, Ugreen’s charger can only supply 7.5W of power to MagSafe-compatible devices, or 5W to a pair of wireless earbuds or any Qi-ready device if you’re using the integrated charging stand located on the bottom.\nIf you need a cheap way to charge your gadgets, Anker’s 30W Nano Charger is matching its all-time low of $12.99 ($3 off) in select colors at Amazon and Anker’s online storefront (with code WS7DV29VBNV2). The single-port USB-C offering doesn’t include a charging cable; however, it does come in a few fun colors and sports a set of folding prongs that allow you to stow it just about anywhere.\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nJBL’s Charge 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in multiple colors starting at $119.95 ($60 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker since July. We’re not huge fans of the oversized JBL logo, but the powerful Bluetooth speaker hits all the right marks when it comes to functionality and performance, offering an impressive 20 hours of battery life and a built-in USB-A port that lets you top off your phone while listening to music.\nDespite the fact the Sonos app has been a bit of a debacle as of late, I have few qualms about recommending the Sonos Era 100 for around $199 ($50 off), its current price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront. It’s a great smart speaker with stereo sound, privacy-conscious microphone controls, and support for both Bluetooth and line-in connections. It can also connect to Spotify and every other music service you can think of and supports AirPlay 2, letting you stream content from Apple devices. Read our review.\nAmazon’s latest Echo Dot is down to $39.99 ($10 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Kohl’s. The tiny, orb-shaped smart speaker features onboard microphones and produces good sound for its size, making it a solid option for listening to music, issuing smart home commands, checking the weather, and making other various Alexa requests. It also includes a built-in temperature sensor, which can tell you the temperature in the room and trigger various Alexa Routines, if necessary.

You can also buy two for $919.99 ($230 off) or three for $1,359.99 ($340 off). The mesh routers support Wi-Fi 7 and feature a pair of 10GB ethernet ports, along with two 2.5GB ethernet ports. They also support Matter as well as Zigbee, and can act as a Thread border router.\nYou can buy the Eve Energy Smart Plug and Power Meter at Amazon for $29.95 ($10 off), an all-time low. Like other smart plugs, Eve’s handy device can turn traditional indoor gadgets like lamps and fans into smart devices; it’s also capable of monitoring your energy use and works with all the major smart home platforms (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, etc.) thanks to its support for the newer Matter standard.\nYou can grab a four-pack of Meross Smart Plug Minis on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $28.99 ($15 off) when you clip the on-page coupon. That brings the handy, hubless smart plugs down to just over $7 a pop, allowing you to control a range of traditional devices via Apple Home, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa without breaking the bank.\nWant a compact smart display for your nightstand? Amazon’s latest Echo Show 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo for $69.99 ($20 off), which is a pretty typical discount. The Alexa-enabled smart display is Amazon’s smallest at 5.5 inches, though it’s still plenty big enough for managing smart home devices and controlling music playback. It also has a 2-megapixel camera (with an integrated privacy shutter), just in case you want to use it for more than a smart alarm clock.\nThe Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is on sale for $69.99 ($20 off) at Amazon and The Home Depot, which is $20 shy of its all-time low and the best price we’ve seen since the holidays. The inexpensive, Alexa-compatible outdoor security camera offers decent 1080p video, sports a 105dB siren, and provides 2,600 lumens of brightness via two onboard floodlights. You can also mount it horizontally or vertically, and the camera provides local recording — assuming you opt for the optional Sync Module 2 and a USB stick. \nAmazon’s Smart Thermostat has returned to $61.99 ($18 off) at Amazon and Kohl’s, which has sort of become its base sale price in recent months. The modern, easy-to-use thermostat allows for easy control of your HVAC even while you’re not home and supports Alexa “hunches” to try and predict what changes you need based on your habits, which could help you save on your monthly bill. Read our review.\nAmazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor is on sale for $54.99 ($15 off) at Amazon, which is $10 shy of its best price yet. Not only does the budget-friendly gadget let you know when your air quality is poor, it can also help improve it by automatically turning on Alexa-enabled devices — including smart thermostats and air purifiers — via Alexa Hunches.  Read our original review.\nTablet and e-reader deals\nIf you prefer a big-screen, note-taking alternative to the Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Colorsoft, the 2024 Kindle Scribe is matching its all-time low of $324.99 ($75 off) at Amazon and Best Buy with 32GB of storage. It remains the biggest Kindle available thanks to its 10.2-inch 300 ppi display, which features a textured cover that makes it feel more akin to writing on paper. The latest model offers a host of new writing features, too, including a tool that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Read our review.\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nOther Verge favorites\nThe Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at Amazon in a myriad of colors starting at $90.99 ($39 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.\nGovee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB. One of its most stunning lights, the Smart Table Lamp 2, is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at Amazon. It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better.\nCagiwiru’s Cordless Air Blower / Duster is down to an all-time low of $18.04 ($7 off) at Amazon (at checkout). It might not be as powerful as a can of compressed air, but it’s close, and it’s much more versatile with its swappable tips, built-in light, and ability to recharge via USB-C.\nThe AeroPress Go is nearly matching its best price to date at Amazon, where you can pick it up for $31.95 ($18 off). It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst Verge staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.\nPet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the ChomChom Roller, especially since it’s currently on sale at Amazon for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair.\nJsaux’s 5-in-1 Docking Station for the Steam Deck (model HB0602) is down to just $18.89 (about $11 off) at Amazon for Prime subscribers. The simple, reliable dock plugs into the PC handheld’s USB-C and offers ports for USB-C pass-through charging, ethernet, two USB-A, and HDMI-out at up to 4K / 60Hz (which is more than enough for the Steam Deck’s specs).\nWe like Hoto’s svelte toolkits for a couple of reasons. They strike a minimalistic look, for one thing, and they incorporate at least one power tool. The company’s Drill Tool Set — which is on sale at Amazon for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.\nHaving access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the LifeStraw Peak is worth picking up at Amazon for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off). It’s essentially a thick straw outfitted with a filter that’s capable of removing 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from the water you’re drinking.\nWildfire season might be a ways off, but if you’d like to get ahead, you can pick up Coway’s Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty from Amazon for $165 ($75 off), which nearly matches its second-best price to date. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at The Verge, we can personally attest to the effectiveness of this midrange model for smaller rooms.\nUpdate, March 31st: Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and remove several expired deals.","summary":"Amazon’s first big sale event of 2025 — the Big Spring Sale, as it is known — is in its final day.

The fitness-friendly buds are a lot like the Sport X10 — which were once our favorite budget earbuds for the gym — only they offer longer battery life, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and multipoint support. They also supposedly offer better noise cancellation and continue to sport an adjustable ear hook, which is a boon if you’re someone who struggles with keeping traditional earbuds in during intense gym sessions.\nIf you’re in the market for a pair of headphones, Sony’s WH-CH520 are on sale at Amazon starting at $35.95 (about $24 off), their lowest price to date. The over-ears offer a solid set of features for their price, including up to 50 hours of battery life, decent sound, and support for both Google Assistant and Siri.\nBluetooth speaker deals\nAmazon’s latest Echo Dot is down to $39.99 ($10 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Kohl’s. The tiny, orb-shaped smart speaker features onboard microphones and produces good sound for its size, making it a solid option for listening to music, issuing smart home commands, checking the weather, and making other various Alexa requests. It also includes a built-in temperature sensor, which can tell you the temperature in the room and trigger various Alexa Routines, if necessary.

The Alexa-enabled smart alarm clock offers a customizable 2.83-inch screen that displays information like the weather; however, unlike Amazon’s larger smart displays, the Spot lacks a camera, so there’s less of a need to worry about privacy when you place it on your bedside table. Read our review.\nSony’s SRS-XB100 speaker is available at Amazon and Best Buy for around $48 ($12 off) or at Target for $39.99 if you’re a member of the retailer’s free loyalty program. Despite the fact it’s tiny, the Bluetooth speaker delivers crisp, clear sound along with up to 16 hours of continuous battery life. It also sports IP67 dust and water resistance, so you can take it hiking or to the pool without worrying. Read our review.\nSoundcore’s Select 4 Go is on sale at Amazon starting at just $19.99 ($10 off), which matches its all-time low. The floatable Bluetooth speaker can last up to 20 hours on a single charge and can be paired with a second Select 4 Go for stereo sound.\nCharging accessory deals\nIf you’re someone who owns (or, someday, envisions owning) USB-C gadgets that draw a lot of power, it’s wise to buy cables with high wattage passthrough, just so you’re ready for the future. Anker’s six-foot 240W USB-C cable is a great candidate, especially since it’s discounted to $16.99 ($8 off) at Amazon.\nUgreen’s Uno lineup of charging accessories aims to be more personable. To that end, its 6.6-foot 1ooW USB-C cable — which is currently discounted to $10.39 ($2.61 off) at Amazon — has expressive, Tamagotchi-like eyes. The reason? There’s no reason — it’s just cute, okay?\nPower banks with built-in USB-C cables are the hot thing right now. As it turns out, having a battery pack that can charge your device in a jiffy and double as a lanyard is pretty great. Luckily, you can snag one of the most affordable 20,000mAh models out there, Anker’s 30W Zolo power bank, for $24.61 (about $11 off) at Amazon. While it’s not powerful enough to quickly charge a Steam Deck that’s running games, it’ll do just fine for charging it (as well as other USB-C devices) while they sleep.\nThe Baseus Free2Pull Retractable USB-C Cable that changed how Verge editor-at-large David Pierce packs his tech bag is on sale at Amazon for just $10.39 ($7 off), its best price yet. The 3.3-foot cable supports 100W passthrough, and perhaps it’ll revolutionize your gadget loadout, too.\nThe Sharge Retractable 65 is on sale for $36 at Amazon for Prime members, down from $49.99. The transparent 65W travel charger sports a classy look, while featuring a built-in retractable USB-C cable and USB-C port so you can charge laptops, phones, and other devices at the same time.\nIf you’re not ready to pony up for a Qi2 charger, Ugreen’s Magnetic Wireless Charging Station has fallen to an all-time low of $21.99 ($14 off) at Amazon. Unlike the newer Qi2 offerings that provide 15W charging speeds, Ugreen’s charger can only supply 7.5W of power to MagSafe-compatible devices, or 5W to a pair of wireless earbuds or any Qi-ready device if you’re using the integrated charging stand located on the bottom.\nSmart home deals\nGovee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB. One of its most stunning lights, the Smart Table Lamp 2, is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at Amazon. It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better.\nWant a compact smart display for your nightstand? Amazon’s latest Echo Show 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo for $69.99 ($20 off), which is a pretty typical discount. The Alexa-enabled smart display is Amazon’s smallest at 5.5 inches, though it’s still plenty big enough for managing smart home devices and controlling music playback. It also has a 2-megapixel camera (with an integrated privacy shutter), just in case you want to use it for more than a smart alarm clock.\nYou can buy the Eve Energy Smart Plug and Power Meter at Amazon for $29.95 ($10 off), an all-time low. Like other smart plugs, Eve’s handy device can turn traditional indoor gadgets like lamps and fans into smart devices; it’s also capable of monitoring your energy use and works with all the major smart home platforms (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, etc.) thanks to its support for the newer Matter standard.\nYou can grab a four-pack of Meross Smart Plug Minis on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $28.99 ($15 off) when you clip the on-page coupon. That brings the handy, hubless smart plugs down to just over $7 a pop, allowing you to control a range of traditional devices via Apple Home, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa without breaking the bank.\nAmazon’s Smart Thermostat has returned to $61.99 ($18 off) at Amazon and Kohl’s, which has sort of become its base sale price in recent months. The modern, easy-to-use thermostat allows for easy control of your HVAC even while you’re not home and supports Alexa “hunches” to try and predict what changes you need based on your habits, which could help you save on your monthly bill. Read our review.\nAmazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor is on sale for $54.99 ($15 off) at Amazon, which is $10 shy of its best price yet. Not only does the budget-friendly gadget let you know when your air quality is poor, it can also help improve it by automatically turning on Alexa-enabled devices — including smart thermostats and air purifiers — via Alexa Hunches. Read our original review.\nSmart security deals\nThe Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is on sale for $69.99 ($20 off) at Amazon and The Home Depot, which is $20 shy of its all-time low and the best price we’ve seen since the holidays. The inexpensive, Alexa-compatible outdoor security camera offers decent 1080p video, sports a 105dB siren, and provides 2,600 lumens of brightness via two onboard floodlights. You can also mount it horizontally or vertically, and the camera provides local recording — assuming you opt for the optional Sync Module 2 and a USB stick.\nOther Verge favorites\nPet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the ChomChom Roller, especially since it’s currently on sale at Amazon for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair.\nJsaux’s 5-in-1 Docking Station for the Steam Deck (model HB0602) is down to just $18.89 (about $11 off) at Amazon for Prime subscribers. The simple, reliable dock plugs into the PC handheld’s USB-C and offers ports for USB-C pass-through charging, ethernet, two USB-A, and HDMI-out at up to 4K / 60Hz (which is more than enough for the Steam Deck’s specs).\nThe AeroPress Go is nearly matching its best price to date at Amazon, where you can pick it up for $31.95 ($18 off). It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst Verge staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.\nThe Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at Amazon in a myriad of colors starting at $90.99 ($39 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.\nCagiwiru’s Cordless Air Blower / Duster is down to $18.88 (about $7 off) at Amazon, nearly matching its all-time low. It might not be as powerful as a can of compressed air, but it’s close, and it’s much more versatile with its swappable tips, built-in light, and ability to recharge via USB-C.\nHaving access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the LifeStraw Peak is worth picking up at Amazon for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off). It’s essentially a thick straw outfitted with a filter that’s capable of removing 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from the water you’re drinking.\nUpdate, March 31st: Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and several new deals, including discounts on Tekton’s Everybit Tech Rescue Kit and Jsaux’s 5-in-1 Docking Station.","summary":"From the Kindle Colorsoft and&#160;Samsung’s new Galaxy S25 to the top-of-the-line Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra, Amazon’s Big Spring Sale has brought steep discounts on some of our favorite gadgets.
