But that’s often what our deal hunters at&nbsp;<em>The Verge&nbsp;</em>are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLXMVMV\">10th-gen iPad of 2022</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display/dp/B0DZ7871B8\">more recent base model with the A16 chip</a> to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CM2y8j\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">iPad (2022)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\"><strong>10th-gen iPad</strong></a> came out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">Apple’s latest entry-level model</a>, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1924288816\">Walmart</a> in select colors starting around $269 ($80 off), which is $20 more than its best price to date. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLDDCGS/\">Amazon</a> is selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for just shy of $400 ($100 off), but <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1104275689\">Walmart</a> handily beats it with a $349 price tag.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-2025-deals\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/apple/636335/ipad-2025-11th-generation-review\">iPad (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As noted above, <strong>Apple’s 11th-gen iPad</strong> just recently landed on the scene. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">new base-model tablet</a> is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is supposedly nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We don’t expect those prices to drop significantly in the coming months, though, if you choose to be an early adopter, the entry-level configuration with 128GB of storage is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ751XN6/?th=1\">Amazon</a> starting at $328 ($22 off). Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ773FRV/\">Amazon</a> starting at $419.99 ($30 off), or the 512GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ75HDQ4/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue/15462502488\">Walmart</a> starting at $614 ($35 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"njqbEo\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review\">iPad Mini (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>The new <strong>seventh-gen iPad Mini</strong> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\">the outgoing model</a> but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering&nbsp;if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, there aren’t any deals available on the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi. You can, however, get the 256GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/13267767957\">Walmart</a> for $589, a measly $10 discount. The 512GB model is also on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XT3DX/\">Amazon</a> for $779 ($20 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-air-2024-deals\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024\">best iPad Air (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024\"><strong>2024 iPad Air</strong></a> isn’t vastly different from the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/623027/apple-ipad-air-2025-launch-price-specs\">new M3 model</a>, it was the first Air available in a 13-inch configuration in addition to an 11-inch base model. Apple also introduced Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, enabling the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the last-gen Air with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features\">Apple Pencil Pro</a> and latest Magic Keyboard, too, and while it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s tablet slate, both the 11- and 13-inch Air are still readily available starting at $599 and $799, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>Discounts are limited on the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi starting; It’s selling at its normal $599 price at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7W33Y/\">Amazon</a> . As for the 13-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage, <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-13-inch-ipad-air-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-128gb-space-gray/6533576.p\">Best Buy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2024-Apple-11-inch-iPad-Air-M2-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue/5769320662\">Walmart</a> are all selling it in select colors starting at around $699 ($100 off), which is $5 more than its lowest price to date.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-air-2025-deals\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025\">best iPad Air (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>2025 iPad Air</strong> is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-Air-M3-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray/15450254481\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/\">Amazon</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1883562-REG/apple_mc9x4ll_a_11_ipad_air_m3.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $549 ($50 off). Amazon also has the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76RM7P/\">256GB model for $649</a> ($50 off) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ7466KC/\">512GB model starting at $849</a> ($50 off).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76QBLQ/\">Amazon</a> with 128GB of storage starting at $729.99 (about $70 off) or $754 at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-13-inch-iPad-Air-M3-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray/15488965670/\">Walmart</a>. You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77K7KT/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1883613-REG/apple_mcnn4ll_a_13_ipad_air_m3.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> for $849 ($100 off), or the 512GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ75PK41/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-13-inch-iPad-Air-M3-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray/15445159388\">Walmart</a> for $1,074, just $25 off.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"iuddo9\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review\">iPad Pro (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Compared to the latest iPad Air, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155440/apple-ipad-pro-2024-review\"><strong>2024 iPad Pro</strong></a> is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24148451/apple-m4-chip-ai-ipad-macbook\">M4 chip</a>, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.</p>\n\n<p>As for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J6L2ZC/\">Amazon</a> starting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price.

The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s latest iPad Air and base iPad.\n \n\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 and the more recent base model with the A16 chip to the more powerful iPad models with M3 and M4 chips.\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\nApple’s 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022. It’s still a great tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by Apple’s latest entry-level model, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nIn the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Walmart in select colors starting around $269 ($80 off), which is $20 more than its best price to date. Amazon is selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for just shy of $400 ($100 off), but Walmart handily beats it with a $349 price tag.\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\nAs noted above, Apple’s 11th-gen iPad just recently landed on the scene. The new base-model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is supposedly nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.\nPricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We don’t expect those prices to drop significantly in the coming months, though, if you choose to be an early adopter, the entry-level configuration with 128GB of storage is currently on sale at Amazon starting at $328 ($22 off). Alternatively, you can grab the 256GB model at Amazon starting at $419.99 ($30 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon and Walmart starting at $614 ($35 off).\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\nRight now, there aren’t any deals available on the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi. You can, however, get the 256GB variant at Walmart for $589, a measly $10 discount. The 512GB model is also on sale at Amazon for $779 ($20 off).\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\nAlthough the 2024 iPad Air isn’t vastly different from the new M3 model, it was the first Air available in a 13-inch configuration in addition to an 11-inch base model. Apple also introduced Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, enabling the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the last-gen Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and latest Magic Keyboard, too, and while it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s tablet slate, both the 11- and 13-inch Air are still readily available starting at $599 and $799, respectively.\nDiscounts are limited on the 11-inch base model with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi starting; It’s selling at its normal $599 price at Amazon . As for the 13-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage, Best Buy and Walmart are all selling it in select colors starting at around $699 ($100 off), which is $5 more than its lowest price to date.\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\nThe 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that make the Air a more credible laptop replacement.\nThe 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Walmart, Amazon, and B&H Photo in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $549 ($50 off). Amazon also has the 256GB model for $649 ($50 off) and the 512GB model starting at $849 ($50 off).\nThe larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is currently on sale at Amazon with 128GB of storage starting at $729.99 (about $70 off) or $754 at Walmart. You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model at Amazon and B&H Photo for $849 ($100 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon and Walmart for $1,074, just $25 off.\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\nCompared to the latest iPad Air, the 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they were the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing. The new Pro models can claim other firsts, too, such as being the first iPad models with OLED displays and the lightest Pros yet, which is true of both sizes. They also feature repositioned front-facing cameras that sit along the horizontal edge, which prevent you from looking as though you’re staring off into space on a video call.\nAs for deals, the 11-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi / 256GB of storage is currently on sale at Amazon starting at $899 ($100 off) — which is about $20 more than its typical sale price. The sleek and super-thin 13-inch model, meanwhile, is on sale in its 256GB base configuration at Amazon starting at $1,099 ($200 off), which is a particularly noteworthy discount.","summary":"While the best iPad deals usually land during major sale events like Black Friday and Amazon Prime Day,&#160;many great iPad deals are attainable outside those times.

In that case, here are the best alternatives to the Oura Ring.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The $400 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables\"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Ring</strong></a><strong> </strong>nails the hardware. Its charging case is more elegant than the Oura Ring’s, and I prefer the slightly concave design for comfort. It also has the second widest size range. If you’re already all-in on a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Ultra</a>, you get the added benefit of extended battery life. If you have the latest <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211507/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review-screen-battery-camera\">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24204714/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-screen-battery-camera\">Z Fold 6</a>, Samsung also has gesture controls for the ring so you can control the camera. There are a lot of interesting ecosystem-centric ideas that Samsung has for its Galaxy Ring, but while there’s no subscription, it’ll cost you a pretty penny to unlock the ring’s full potential. Without discounts, we’re talking about $1,800 to nearly $3,000 for the phone, watch, and ring. The Galaxy Ring is also a first-gen device with some first-gen quirks. Samsung is still catching up with sleep tracking accuracy, and its Galaxy AI-powered health features are rather hit or miss.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m also keen on the $350 <strong><a href=\"https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/buy/us/\">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a></strong>. It gave the Oura Ring an honest run for its money when I tested six smart rings at once last year. It’s not quite as good with accuracy, but it’s on par with comfort and design. The app has much more of a fitness focus than wellness. Instead of a subscription, it has “Power Plugs.” You can think of them as add-on features. Some are free, like smart alarms and cycle tracking. Others will come with an additional fee, like a planned atrial fibrillation detection Power Plug and a cardio adaptability metric, which costs $2.90 a month.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lastly, I’ve been testing the <strong><a href=\"https://ringconn.com/products/ringconn-gen-2-air?variant=48494897791284\">RingConn Gen 2 Air</a></strong>, a slimmer, entry-level version of its Gen 2 ring. At $200, it’s the most affordable smart ring I’ve tested but looks and feels a lot nicer than the original RingConn I tested last summer. I had issues with the RingConn’s squarish shape, but it’s much less noticeable this time around and more comfortable. It’s broadly accurate, and the app goes heavy on AI, to middling effect. It has great battery life. I’ve gotten around eight to nine days on a single charge — far better than any other smart ring I’ve tested. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"So, you’re thinking of buying a smart ring.

If you have the latest Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Z Fold 6, Samsung also has gesture controls for the ring so you can control the camera. There are a lot of interesting ecosystem-centric ideas that Samsung has for its Galaxy Ring, but while there’s no subscription, it’ll cost you a pretty penny to unlock the ring’s full potential. Without discounts, we’re talking about $1,800 to nearly $3,000 for the phone, watch, and ring. The Galaxy Ring is also a first-gen device with some first-gen quirks. Samsung is still catching up with sleep tracking accuracy, and its Galaxy AI-powered health features are rather hit or miss.\nI’m also keen on the $350 Ultrahuman Ring Air. It gave the Oura Ring an honest run for its money when I tested six smart rings at once last year. It’s not quite as good with accuracy, but it’s on par with comfort and design. The app has much more of a fitness focus than wellness. Instead of a subscription, it has “Power Plugs.” You can think of them as add-on features. Some are free, like smart alarms and cycle tracking. Others will come with an additional fee, like a planned atrial fibrillation detection Power Plug and a cardio adaptability metric, which costs $2.90 a month.\nLastly, I’ve been testing the RingConn Gen 2 Air, a slimmer, entry-level version of its Gen 2 ring. At $200, it’s the most affordable smart ring I’ve tested but looks and feels a lot nicer than the original RingConn I tested last summer. I had issues with the RingConn’s squarish shape, but it’s much less noticeable this time around and more comfortable. It’s broadly accurate, and the app goes heavy on AI, to middling effect. It has great battery life. I’ve gotten around eight to nine days on a single charge — far better than any other smart ring I’ve tested.","summary":"So, you’re thinking of buying a smart ring. Well, some good news. Picking the best of the lot is incredibly easy right now. The “bad” news is that, as far as trustworthiness and reliability, your choices are somewhat limited, as this is still a niche and emerging gadget category. Smart rings are in the middle [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/?p=647901","isoDate":"2025-04-14T20:04:57.000Z"},{"title":"OpenAI debuts its GPT-4.1 flagship AI model","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/647896/openai-chatgpt-gpt-4-1-mini-nano-launch-availability","pubDate":"2025-04-14T17:42:38.000Z","author":"Jess Weatherbed","content":"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<figure>\n\n<img alt=\"\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/STK155_OPEN_AI_2025_CVirgiia_C.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" />\n\t<figcaption></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">OpenAI has introduced GPT-4.1, a successor to the GPT-4o multimodal AI model launched by the company last year.
