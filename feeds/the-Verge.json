And while Nintendo has taken steps to address the dreaded <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained\">Joy-Con drift</a> and earlier quality control problems, some issues persist.

We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re similar to each other and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (<a href=\"https://www.powera.com/c/nintendo/nintendo-switch/controllers/\">PowerA</a> and <a href=\"https://pdp.com/collections/nintendo-switch-controllers\">PDP</a> make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), they likely won’t support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to turn on the Switch remotely. However, there are exceptions that we feature below!</p>\n\n<p>If you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official <a href=\"https://howl.link/lij43lpwkhtzg\">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a>. It’s the only traditional gamepad that includes every feature mentioned above, and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joysticks-Compatible-macOS-Black-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0D3X6THN8\">GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joysticks-Compatible-macOS-Black-Nintendo-DS/dp/B0CQLNSGH4\">Max</a>, meanwhile, make for great Xbox-style controllers with exhaustive customization, while the <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/HORI-Nintendo-Switch-Split-Pad-Pro-Ergonomic-Controller-for-Handheld-Mode-Officially-Licensed-By-Nintendo-Black/539959895\">Hori Split Pad Pro</a> is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode.

We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch and other compatible platforms, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, racers like <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, and shooters like <em>Overwatch 2</em>. We pay attention to how buttons, triggers, analog sticks, and the D-pad feel, noting whether any of them feel mushy or stiff. For controllers that support sensitivity customization, we note how easy it is to make these adjustments and how they feel compared to their default settings.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Connectivity</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Does it support Bluetooth?

It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.</p>\n\n<p>Given the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973\">if you have no more than two controllers</a> connected to your Switch at once.)</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xKHdxh\">The best Switch controller for handheld mode</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms: </strong>Switch / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Joy-Con slots / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Rumble:</strong> No / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> via Joy-Con slots / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p>I’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.</p>\n\n<p>The Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch&nbsp;console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23334097/cfaulkner_141231_5091_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Split Pad Pro fits in your Switch’s Joy-Con slots and doubles as a standalone controller with the optional attachment set.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC&nbsp;— so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23007610/hori-split-pad-pro-attachment-nintendo-switch-price-features-review\">Split Pad Pro Attachment</a> seen above that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).</p>\n\n<p>The company also sells the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/12/23348870/hori-split-pad-compact-nintendo-switch-joy-con-price-features\">Split Pad Compact</a>, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Split-Compact-Light-Yellow/dp/B0BDSNHLDY\"><strong>costs $50</strong></a> (you can also get it <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/hori-split-pad-compact-attachment-set-for-nintendo-switch-slate-gray/6577878.p\">with an Attachment Set for $74.99</a>).

We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.</p>\n\n<p>But there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JluAuIJ-tSY\">iFixit explains here</a>. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features\">Xbox Elite Series 2</a> and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/gulikit-kk3-pro.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723395278369,100,78.553209443262\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;GuliKit’s newest Switch controllers offer ample customization.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer <em>a lot</em> for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nwIiGD\">The best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble:</strong> Yes / <strong>NFC:</strong> No / <strong>Motion: </strong>Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B9BGJVLL\">8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a> feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. </p>\n\n<p>It also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the  battery. Speaking of, it typically lasts around 22 hours, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.</p>\n\n<p>The Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options for a couple of reasons. One because it’s the only version of the Ultimate that’s compatible with the Switch. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24827602/61ZrQruCQWL._SL1500_.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.772212081113,100,78.455575837775\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 8BitDo Ultimate is a terrific alternative to Nintendo’s official pro controller.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>As for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"DQLgpj\">A well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Supported Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / <strong>Connectivity:</strong> Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Yes / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Rumble: </strong>Yes / <strong>NFC: </strong>No / <strong>Motion:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power: </strong>Built-in rechargeable / <strong>Console Wakeup:</strong> No</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSPH1JYV/ref=twister_B0D1HQLSJ1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;th=1\">8BitDo Pro 2</a> is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller layout. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. </p>\n\n<p>It has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23387041/overwatch-2-review-new-battle-pass-heroes-maps\"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a>, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25570786/8bitdo.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;You can get the 8BitDo Pro 2 in a variety of fun styles.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html\">8BitDo’s Ultimate software</a>&nbsp;on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks.

Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09M8CVMYF\">$19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2</a> lets you turn a Bluetooth&nbsp;controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)</p>\n\n<p>To our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app.&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8bitdo-wireless-usb-adapter-2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,11.337092227145,100,77.325815545711\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;8BitDo’s dongle supports most Bluetooth controllers, including official Xbox and PlayStation gamepads.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 8BitDo\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: 8BitDo\" />\n<p><a href=\"https://support.8bitdo.com/Manual/USB-Adapter-2/xbox-switch.html\">8BitDo has an extensive support page</a> that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.</p>\n\n<p>If you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PKG18DR\">and a USB hub</a>), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ayIYQW\">Other Switch controllers we tested</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pJBZ31\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-Professional-Handheld-Nintendo/dp/B0CFLVJBBD/\">Nitro Deck</a> / <a href=\"https://amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8YGPT3G/\">Nitro Deck Plus</a></h3>\n\n<p>We like CRKD’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/28/24017863/nitro-deck-micro-review\"><strong>Nitro Deck</strong></a> around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up <a href=\"https://crkd.gg/collections/allndp\"><strong>Nitro Deck Plus</strong></a> adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lK3UFj\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Mag-ResTM-Lightning-Mac/dp/B0DK4NPYX6/\">GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</a></h3>\n\n<p>We recently tested the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-PC-Mag-ResTM-Lightning-Mac/dp/B0DK4NPYX6/\"><strong>GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro</strong></a> ($45.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Controller-Joysticks-Triggers-Vibration-nintendo/dp/B0D41BBD7P\">GuliKit KingKong 3 </a>— including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"lru39S\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\">PowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller</a></h3>\n\n<p>We also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-GameCube/dp/B0CT5JPCCC\"><strong>GameCube Style Wireless Controller</strong></a> ($38.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Black/dp/B098TX8QB6\"><strong>PowerA Enhanced Wireless</strong></a><strong> </strong>($55.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24051677/nintendo-switch-2-pro-rumors-news\">Switch 2</a> is what’s coming next. Nintendo’s new console <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details\">launches on June 5</a>, and it’s both bigger and more powerful than the original model. Suffice it to say, there will be many new accessories at launch, including new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo\">Joy-Con 2 controllers</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details\">refreshed Switch Pro Controller</a> that features customizable rear paddles.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Thankfully, Nintendo has <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68426/~/nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-accessory-compatibility\">published an in-depth support page</a> regarding the Switch 2’s compatibility (or lack of compatibility) for original Switch accessories. Good news: most of them will work just fine. They just won’t have the C button.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern, since most manufacturers are likely at work on Switch 2 controllers. 8BitDo has announced a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/648989/8bitdo-ultimate-2-bluetooth-controller-nintendo-switch?_gl=1*msccoq*_up*MQ..*_gs*MQ..&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwqv2_BhC0ARIsAFb5Ac-c__RUHiTpkj7NYaUilo0dRXEsyhhRHqkR05sQQVbYeNO9ItUm4N0aAsh2EALw_wcB&amp;gbraid=0AAAAA9k5E7DxDC-acgjo1JjJa5osaZB2D\">Switch-compatible Ultimate 2 controller with TMR analog sticks</a> that costs $69.99.

While the removable Joy-Cons included with all non-Lite Switch consoles are convenient given they can be detached for wireless use, their tiny, curveless design isn’t comfortable for long gaming sessions or large hands. And while Nintendo has taken steps to address the dreaded Joy-Con drift and earlier quality control problems, some issues persist. The company claims that the Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 controllers will be more durable, but we’ll have to wait and see.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nThe best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nWhat’s coming next?\n\nIn this buying guide, we focus on wireless controllers that are both comfortable and reliable, as well as a few options that come with unique features designed to match your play style. We’re not covering wired controllers that plug into the Switch’s dock, as they’re similar to each other and don’t offer substantial savings in many cases. (PowerA and PDP make decent ones that will do in a pinch, but they’re very basic. Unless you detest recharging your controllers, it makes more sense to go wireless.)\nAlso, if you buy a third-party wireless controller (as in, one not made by Nintendo), they likely won’t support HD rumble, motion controls, NFC for Amiibo, or be able to turn on the Switch remotely. However, there are exceptions that we feature below!\nIf you’re playing your Switch while docked, it’s hard to go wrong with the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. It’s the only traditional gamepad that includes every feature mentioned above, and it’s one of the most satisfying controllers we’ve tested. The GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and Max, meanwhile, make for great Xbox-style controllers with exhaustive customization, while the Hori Split Pad Pro is great for those who prefer to play in handheld mode. Then there’s 8BitDo’s PC-friendly Ultimate Bluetooth Controller and DualShock-esque Pro 2 controller, both of which are worth checking out.\n\n\nHow we test Nintendo Switch controllers\nWe test Nintendo Switch controllers by playing with them with a standard grip — the same way most gamers do. We test how easy they are to connect to the Switch and other compatible platforms, as well as how reliably they stay connected. Then, we jump into a game. Since some controllers are better suited to specific genres than others, we try a variety of titles, including fighting games like Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, racers like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and shooters like Overwatch 2. We pay attention to how buttons, triggers, analog sticks, and the D-pad feel, noting whether any of them feel mushy or stiff. For controllers that support sensitivity customization, we note how easy it is to make these adjustments and how they feel compared to their default settings.\n\n\n\n\n\nConnectivity\nDoes it support Bluetooth? Can you use it in wired mode? Are there alternate wireless modes, such as 2.4GHz?\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality\nDo the buttons, sticks, and triggers feel good and sturdy? Does the controller have a satisfying, well-balanced weight? Does it use premium materials for the casing and grips? Any connection issues or glitches?\n\n\n\n\n\nExtra features\nAre there rear-facing buttons? Does it support macros? Can you use it on multiple platforms?\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomization\nCan you remap buttons? Is there software support for tweaking controller settings? Does it have interchangeable buttons or sticks? Can you fine-tune vibration and sensitivity?\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nIs it priced fairly? Are the features and quality worth the money?\n\n\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for TV mode\nSupported platforms: Nintendo Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes, HD / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nEver since the Switch launched, Nintendo’s first-party Pro controller has been the best gamepad for the console. In many ways, it rivals the standard models from Sony and Microsoft in terms of comfort and build quality.\nAside from the Joy-Cons, the Switch Pro Controller is the only wireless option that includes HD rumble, gyroscopic movement support, and an NFC reader for Amiibo cards and figurines. It’s one of a few controllers we’ve tested (aside from the Joy-Con and 8BitDo’s Ultimate series) that can power on the Switch without being plugged into it. The gamepad is built like a tank, and its battery life is so good that it sometimes seems like it’ll never run out. Nintendo says that it lasts around 40 hours per charge, so it’ll likely take casual gamers a long time to run down the battery.\nThe buttons and triggers have a satisfying bounce, while its directional pad is responsive and clicky enough to satisfy retro gamers. The controller charges via USB-C, just like the Switch, and it’s compatible with a slew of other platforms you might game on, including PC, Android, and SteamOS. It also works with Apple devices thanks to its compatibility with the latest versions of iOS, macOS, and even tvOS and visionOS.\nGiven the price, we wish that it had other features, like programmable buttons or a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio, even if wireless audio transmission from the Switch to a controller isn’t currently possible. (At least you can connect a pair of wireless headphones via Bluetooth, but only if you have no more than two controllers connected to your Switch at once.)\nThe best Switch controller for handheld mode\nSupported Platforms: Switch / Connectivity: Wired / Connector type: Joy-Con slots / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: No / NFC: No / Motion: No / Power: via Joy-Con slots / Console Wakeup: No\nI’m sure there are some people who enjoy using Joy-Con controllers, but kids and small-handed folks aside, most people probably wouldn’t say they’re the most comfortable option. If you struggle with hand pain when you use the Switch, that’s where the Hori Split Pad Pro comes in.\nThe Split Pad Pro comes in a variety of colorways, and it both looks and feels like a Switch Pro Controller that’s split in half. One half slides into each side of the Switch console like Joy-Cons, but unlike Nintendo’s default controllers, Hori’s gamepad features big, easy-to-reach buttons and generously sized triggers and analog sticks, all of which feel great in play. It also provides a lot of grip, which is particularly useful for people who need to get a better handle on the console for fast gameplay or stay comfy over longer play sessions.\nThe Split Pad Pro doesn’t have batteries or sensors — or support for rumble, motion, IR, or NFC — so it’s completely useless when detached from the Switch. It’s only for handheld mode unless you purchase the Split Pad Pro Attachment seen above that turns it into a wired controller. We don’t recommend most people go that route since the attachment alone costs more than a Switch Pro Controller, which is a shame considering it doesn’t add any of the aforementioned elements (it does add a 3.5mm headphone jack, however).\nThe company also sells the Split Pad Compact, which is a smaller version of the Split Pad Pro that costs $50 (you can also get it with an Attachment Set for $74.99). It might be worth a look if you want something as functional as the Split Pad Pro but closer in size to a Joy-Con.\nRead our Hori Split Pad Pro review.\nThe best Xbox-style controller for the Switch\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: No / Rumble: Yes / NFC: Yes / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: Yes\nOn the surface, the GuliKit KingKong 3 Pro and KingKong 3 Max are similar to the last-gen models they replaced, which took design cues from Microsoft’s standard Xbox controller but rivaled the Switch Pro Controller in terms of build quality and features. We tested them on the Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile, but you can also use them with other Bluetooth devices, including the Steam Deck and Apple TV 4K.\nBut there are several notable improvements and additions if you scratch deeper. They each have Hall effect dual-mode triggers (both can switch between analog and digital, but the KK3 Max exclusively adds physical trigger stops), in addition to RGB LED-surrounded Hall effect analog sticks. It should make them virtually impervious to drifting and waning responsiveness, as iFixit explains here. They each have GuliKit’s powerful magnetic vibration motors with two intensity levels and three distinct modes (including the Switch’s HD rumble). You can even customize the hot-swappable face buttons to match your preferred platform, and to the delight of tournament players, you can play with a 1,000Hz polling rate for reduced input lag on PC (wired or wireless via a dongle).\nAdditionally, both controllers feature detachable rear-facing paddles. You get two metal moon-shaped paddles with the KK3 Pro that protrude further from the controller than the extra four you get with the KK3 Max, which are longer and curved to match the contour of the controllers’ rear grips. The latter are similar to the paddles on the Xbox Elite Series 2 and even borrow the same installation technique — just push them into the designated holes on the back. They require a lot more force, though they won’t easily dislodge. \nThe longer paddles are comfortably reachable once installed, but if you have larger hands, you may need to make adjustments for the shorter variety. They only need a light tap, but since they occupy the space where your fingers usually rest, it can lead to increased misfires while gaming. You can map each back button to emulate any other button on the controller — including the rear triggers — but you can’t configure them to execute combo presses or macros.\nIn summary, the KK3 Pro and KK3 Max offer a lot for the money. In fact, there may be no better option for interoperability and value in a single multiplatform controller right now. If we’re nitpicking, our biggest gripe is that GuliKit still hasn’t created an app to manage all of its settings more easily.\nThe best Switch controller that’s also great for PC and Steam Deck\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV / Connectivity: 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\n8BitDo’s Ultimate Bluetooth Controller feels like a Switch Pro Controller in shape, with a similarly short grip profile that larger hands may not prefer. Both share Switch and Windows PC support, but 8BitDo gets a leg up with full Steam Deck compatibility. Its haptics are decent but not as good as Nintendo’s, and it’s missing Amiibo support, though it does feature customizable back paddles and motion controls — along with a hidden trick that allows you to wake a docked Switch by giving the controller a little shake. \nIt also comes with a charging dock, which stores the 2.4GHz dongle when not in use. The included dock is handy for charging the  battery. Speaking of, it typically lasts around 22 hours, which is still pretty generous but comes well short of the 40-hour mark set by Nintendo’s official controller.\nThe Ultimate controller comes in several variants, but we recommend the Bluetooth model over the 2.4GHz or wired options for a couple of reasons. One because it’s the only version of the Ultimate that’s compatible with the Switch. Plus, it includes both 2.4GHz connectivity and GuliKit Hall effect sticks, which the 2.4GHz-only version lacks. The analog sticks offer just the right amount of resistance and sport a comfortable concave top, but they’re just a tad short on the sides. All of the buttons offer great travel, though, and the analog triggers have a satisfying amount of resistance when pulled.\nAs for tweaks, you can customize button mapping profiles, macros, vibration intensity, and stick and trigger sensitivity using the Ultimate Software app on mobile or PC. The controller has a dedicated button that lets you swap between three profiles on the fly, plus an extra turbo button you can either reconfigure or remap. When it comes to Switch controllers, 8BitDo sets the standard for the breadth of these options and how to access them, which is another reason it’s high on our list.\nA well-rounded Switch controller that looks like a DualShock\nSupported Platforms: Switch, PC, Steam Deck, mobile, Apple TV, Raspberry Pi / Connectivity: Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Yes / Software customization: Yes / Rumble: Yes / NFC: No / Motion: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable / Console Wakeup: No\nThe 8BitDo Pro 2 is another great option with Hall effect sticks for the Nintendo Switch, especially if your hands are happiest with a PlayStation-style controller layout. The Pro 2 has a comfortable grip, a crisper D-pad than the Switch Pro Controller, and two easy-to-press paddle buttons on the underside. \nIt has rumble support (though not HD rumble) and motion control for games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Overwatch 2, both of which allow for gyroscopic aiming. PlayStation gamers will also appreciate that the left analog stick is located toward the bottom — just like on Sony’s controllers — rather than above the D-pad as on the Switch Pro.\nWith 8BitDo’s Ultimate software on a mobile device or a Windows computer, you can customize the Pro 2’s button mapping and the sensitivity of its triggers and analog sticks. You can even save up to three control scheme profiles and cycle through them with a button located between the analog sticks. \nOn its rear, there’s a switch that lets it toggle between Nintendo Switch, X-input for PC, DirectInput, and macOS modes, each with its own control customizations and Bluetooth profile. This controller offers a lot for $50 (or $54.99 if you want one of the incredibly cool translucent blue, purple, or green editions).\nRead our 8BitDo Pro 2 review.\nAn adapter that lets you use your own controllers\nThere are many other devices that allow you to use third-party controllers, but 8BitDo’s might be the best value. Instead of spending $70 on multiple Switch Pro Controllers, the $19.99 8BitDo Wireless Bluetooth USB Adapter 2 lets you turn a Bluetooth controller you already own into a wireless Switch controller. It plugs into your Switch dock and supports a wide variety of models, from the latest Xbox and DualSense controllers to last-gen gamepads for the Wii and PlayStation 3. (Note: the first-gen model can’t connect to most Xbox Bluetooth controllers due to a Bluetooth incompatibility, so make sure you get the latest model.)\nTo our surprise, the PS5 DualSense controller we tested it with worked incredibly well, with better-than-average rumble and more responsive motion controls than many dedicated Switch controllers offer. What’s more, so long as you’re using one of the newer Xbox Series X or S controllers, an Xbox One Bluetooth controller, a DualSense, a DualShock 4, or the Switch Pro Controller, you can customize their button mapping, analog stick sensitivity, and more within 8BitDo’s computer and mobile app. \n8BitDo has an extensive support page that lists the steps required to set up your specific controller, as well as which features of those controllers it supports. That said, it’s best if you know the Switch’s button layout by heart if you plan to use either a PlayStation or Xbox controller with this adapter, as the layout on your controller will not match the on-screen prompts in games.\nIf you already have a controller you really like and don’t mind jumping through a few small hoops to connect it, 8BitDo’s affordable adapter deserves a spot in your entertainment center. If you plan to use more than one third-party controller at a time, you’ll need an adapter for each controller (and a USB hub), but if you have a lot of controllers sitting around, it might be worth it.\nOther Switch controllers we tested\nNitro Deck / Nitro Deck Plus\nWe like CRKD’s Nitro Deck around here. It’s a cradle-style controller that holds the Switch between a pair of Hall effect sticks, outfitting it with a standard array of face buttons, four programmable back buttons, turbo functionality, gyro motion controls, and rumble. It has passthrough charging, though not passthrough video, which would allow it to double as a dock for TV gameplay. The step-up Nitro Deck Plus adds said functionality (with a USB-C to HDMI adapter), along with Bluetooth connectivity and adjustable vibration intensity / analog sensitivity. We’ve found these to be notable improvements, but we wish the passthrough solution was more elegant and that CRKD could solve the ergonomics (particularly on the right side, where the analog and button placement can cause discomfort).\nGameSir T4 Cyclone Pro\nWe recently tested the GameSir T4 Cyclone Pro ($45.99) for consideration. It offers a few of the same functions as the GuliKit KingKong 3 — including remappable buttons, Hall effect sticks, and two distinct macro buttons — along with dedicated vibration motors in the triggers, which is something the GuliKit doesn’t match. That said, it falls just short due to mushy-feeling buttons. GameSir considers the extra padding under the buttons a feature that makes the impact softer, but we felt it takes away from the experience. Also, although it’s perfectly usable with the Switch, the Pro’s button labeling takes after Microsoft’s, which may not be ideal for those who have trouble memorizing inputs. We also found resyncing with the Switch to be a chore after switching from a mobile device or a Windows PC.\nPowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller\nWe also recently tried several wireless PowerA controllers, including the GameCube Style Wireless Controller ($38.99) and a Pikachu-themed version of the standard PowerA Enhanced Wireless ($55.99). We like the fun design of PowerA’s controllers, but they don’t live up to the quality of the models we recommend above, which is a shame considering some cost nearly as much. The GameCube-style wireless controller is a pretty faithful recreation of the original if you fancy a pure Super Smash Bros. experience, but it’s barebones with no rumble, NFC, or IR. It’s an easy way to get the old-school feeling back if you don’t already have a Bluetooth-based alternative to use with 8BitDo’s USB Adapter 2.\nWhat’s coming next?\nThe Switch 2 is what’s coming next. Nintendo’s new console launches on June 5, and it’s both bigger and more powerful than the original model. Suffice it to say, there will be many new accessories at launch, including new Joy-Con 2 controllers and a refreshed Switch Pro Controller that features customizable rear paddles.\nThat brings into question whether existing Switch controllers will work with the Switch 2 at all. Thankfully, Nintendo has published an in-depth support page regarding the Switch 2’s compatibility (or lack of compatibility) for original Switch accessories. Good news: most of them will work just fine. They just won’t have the C button.\nAs for new controllers for the original Switch, we’re in a bit of a holding pattern, since most manufacturers are likely at work on Switch 2 controllers. 8BitDo has announced a Switch-compatible Ultimate 2 controller with TMR analog sticks that costs $69.99. There’s nothing else notable on the immediate horizon, however, and that probably won’t change until the Switch 2 arrives later this year.\nUpdate, April 16th: Updated to reflect current pricing / availability, and added a link to the new Switch-ready Ultimate 2 controller with TMR sticks from 8BitDo.","summary":"The best Nintendo Switch controllers aren’t the ones that come with the console.

The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited.

You can always buy a tablet or use your phone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on X. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality.\n \n\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\n\nAmazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its ever-expanding Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons. The bulk of the devices function as simple ebook readers; however, with the Kindle Scribe, Amazon is moving beyond books and into the realm of writing — something that should make future Kindles function more akin to physical paper.\nBelow, we’ve listed each model currently available. Sometimes there isn’t a deal for one or even any of the products, but in those cases, we’ve listed the most recent sale price.\nThe best Kindle (2024) deals\nWhat does it mean when a Kindle is “ad-supported”?\nAmazon Kindle e-readers come in different storage configurations, but there is also an additional option that allows you to buy the e-reader with or without ads. Ad-supported Kindles will display personalized advertisements on the lock screen when it is in sleep mode or at the bottom of the homescreen when the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Typically, you save about $20 by buying the ad-supported version, but if you decide to remove ads later, you can make a one-time payment to cover the difference and remove the ads.\nIn case you missed it, Amazon announced a new entry-level Kindle in October, one that was designed to replace the outgoing 2022 model. The latest Kindle — which starts at $109.99 — boasts a brighter 94-nit display, improved contrast levels, and slightly faster page turns. It also comes in a “matcha” green instead of “denim,” just in case you’re not a fan of the default black color. Otherwise, though, it’s nearly identical to its predecessor, with the same six-inch 300ppi screen, support for USB-C, and 16GB of base storage.\nIn the past, Amazon’s newest ad-supported Kindle has dropped to as low as $84.99 ($25 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited. Right now, however, you can only buy the Kindle at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for its full retail price of $109.99. \nThe best Kindle Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also updated its kid-friendly Kindle in late 2024. The new Kindle Kids is identical to the standard model but comes with several accessories and provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books. Like the last-gen Kindle Kids, the latest model retails for $20 more than the base model, bringing the MSRP to $129.99.\nIn terms of add-ons, the new Kindle Kids edition consists of four items: the device, a protective case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and six months of Amazon Kids Plus. This last is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns and lack of ads, as it allows parents to grant their child access to games, videos, and books — including those in the Percy Jackson and Harry Potter series — at no additional cost.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the new Kindle Kids sell for as low as $94.99 ($35 off). Right now, however, you can only buy the e-reader at its full price of $129.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite (2024) deals\nThe latest Kindle Paperwhite, which launched last year, is Amazon’s 12th-gen model. Considering it’s one of the company’s higher-end configurations, it offers all the features found in the entry-level Kindle, including USB-C charging and a crisp 300ppi display. That being said, it’s noticeably faster than Amazon’s base ebook reader and features IPX8 waterproofing, a larger seven-inch display, and longer battery life.\nLike other Kindles, the new Paperwhite is available in a few different configurations. There’s an ad-free Signature Edition for $199.99, which is identical to the standard model but comes with 32GB of storage, Qi wireless charging, and a backlight that will automatically adjust when needed. There’s also a Paperwhite Kids for $179.99, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nIn the past, we’ve seen the Paperwhite drop to as low as $129.99. Unfortunately, the standalone model is currently only available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $159.99 (its full retail price). If you’re okay with purchasing a bundle, you can also grab it at Amazon with a power adapter and a black, green, or pink fabric cover for $196.97 ($20 off) or with a plant-based black, green, or pink leather cover for $202.97 ($20 off).\nRead our Kindle Paperwhite (2024) review.\nAs for the ad-free Signature Edition, it’s available at Amazon and Best Buy right now for $199.99 — its regular retail price. You can also grab it at Amazon with a wireless charging dock and a black, green, or pink fabric cover starting at $251.97 ($25 off) or with a plant-based black, green, or pink leather cover for $257.97 ($25 off).\nThe best Kindle Paperwhite Kids (2024) deals\nAmazon also rolled out a Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $179.99 in 2024. It’s identical to the standard Kindle Paperwhite, with the same waterproof design and sharp, seven-inch display. However, like the Kindle Kids, the e-reader is free of ads and offers parental controls you can turn off. It also comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and six months of Amazon Kids Plus.\nWe recently saw the latest Kindle Paperwhite Kids drop as low as $139.99 ($40 off), but right now you can only buy it at its full price of $179.99 at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target.\nThe best Kindle Scribe (2024) deals\nLike its predecessor, the second-gen Kindle Scribe is Amazon’s biggest e-reader. It packs a 10.2-inch display with 300 dpi, along with the same great battery life for which Kindles have become known. What separates the Scribe from other Kindles, however, is that it comes with a stylus, which can be used to jot down notes or doodle in the ebook reader’s built-in notebook. With the latest Scribe, Amazon also introduced a new Active Canvas feature, so you can scribble notes directly on ebook pages, as well as a suite of AI-powered features that can summarize your notes and refine your handwriting.\nRight now, you can buy the entry-level Kindle Scribe at an all-time low of $324.99 ($75 off) at Amazon and Best Buy. Amazon is additionally offering a $40 discount when you buy two.\nYou can also save money if you purchase the base Scribe as a part of a bundle with a 9W power adapter, a Premium Pen, and either a plant-based leather cover starting at $434.97 ($55 off) or a premium leather cover starting at $459.97 ($60 off). Alternatively, the 64GB version is available with the same accessories and a plant-based leather cover for $479.97 ($60 off) or a premium leather cover for $504.97 ($65 off).\nRead our Kindle Scribe (2024) review.\nThe best Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition deals\nIn October, Amazon announced its first color e-reader, the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition.
