But that level of precision can come at the cost of large memory footprints (in the hundreds of gigabytes for the largest models) and significant processing resources needed for the complex matrix multiplication used when responding to prompts.\nNow, researchers at Microsoft's General Artificial Intelligence group have released a new neural network model that works with just three distinct weight values: -1, 0, or 1. Building on top of previous work Microsoft Research published in 2023, the new model's \"ternary\" architecture reduces overall complexity and \"substantial advantages in computational efficiency,\" the researchers write, allowing it to run effectively on a simple desktop CPU. And despite the massive reduction in weight precision, the researchers claim that the model \"can achieve performance comparable to leading open-weight, full-precision models of similar size across a wide range of tasks.\"\nWatching your weights\nThe idea of simplifying model weights isn't a completely new one in AI research. For years, researchers have been experimenting with quantization techniques that squeeze their neural network weights into smaller memory envelopes. In recent years, the most extreme quantization efforts have focused on so-called \"BitNets\" that represent each weight in a single bit (representing +1 or -1).\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kyle Orland\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/microsoft-researchers-create-super%e2%80%91efficient-ai-that-uses-up-to-96-less-energy/#comments","content":"\n            Future AI might not need supercomputers thanks to models like BitNet b1.58 2B4T.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Future AI might not need supercomputers thanks to models like BitNet b1.58 2B4T.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/microsoft-researchers-create-super%e2%80%91efficient-ai-that-uses-up-to-96-less-energy/","categories":["AI"],"isoDate":"2025-04-18T19:46:06.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Kevin Purdy\n        ","title":"Synology confirms that higher-end NAS products will require its branded drives","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/synology-confirms-need-for-synology-branded-drives-in-newer-plus-series-nas/","pubDate":"Fri, 18 Apr 2025 18:50:26 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Popular NAS-maker Synology has confirmed and slightly clarified <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/synology-could-bring-certified-drive-requirements-to-more-nas-devices/\">a policy that appeared on its German website</a> earlier this week: Its <a href=\"https://www.synology.com/en-us/products?product_line=ds_plus\">\"Plus\" tier of devices</a>, starting with the 2025 series, will require Synology-branded hard drives for full compatibility, at least at first.</p>\n<p>\"Synology-branded drives will be needed for use in the newly announced Plus series, with plans to update the Product Compatibility List as additional drives can be thoroughly vetted in Synology systems,\" a Synology representative told Ars by email. \"Extensive internal testing has shown that drives that follow a rigorous validation process when paired with Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues.\"</p>\n<p>Without a Synology-branded or approved drive in a device that requires it, NAS devices could fail to create storage pools and lose volume-wide deduplication and lifespan analysis, <a href=\"https://www.synology.com/en-eu/company/news/article/DACH_VL_plus/Synology%20is%20increasingly%20relying%20on%20its%20own%20ecosystem%20for%20upcoming%20Plus%20models\">Synology's German press release stated</a>.
