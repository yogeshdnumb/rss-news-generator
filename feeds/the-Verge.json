It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been fully dethroned in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">guide to the best laptops</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.

Although its M2 processor didn’t kick-start a revolution like the M1 generation, it’s a great performer for any user, including more demanding creatives.</p>\n\n<p>It does have some slight downsides, though, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191141/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2-base-model-slow-device\">slower storage in the base 256GB configuration</a> and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen.

However, you can get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLHCWH55\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/wu6vd863qyqe0\">Best Buy</a> starting at $799 ($150 off), which is $50 shy of its all-time low.

While it’s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"DTHGG6\">M3 MacBook Air</h3>\n\n<p>The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review\">M3 MacBook Air</a> to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13- and 15-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged\">now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air in its new entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860126-REG/apple_mc8k4ll_a_13_macbook_air_m3.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHG1HML/\">Amazon</a> in select colors starting at $849 ($250 off), which is its best price to date.

Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As of this week, you can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $949 ($50 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/\">Amazon</a> (at checkout). My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members can also get the <a href=\"https://howl.link/6s9db0kxspn4c\">13-inch model on sale for $949</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 10-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($50 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDB8H69/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/trz6011xbasgj\">Best Buy</a>, though the latter retailer requires a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"RdiMiF\">The best MacBook Pro deals</h2>\n\n<p>During its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23933672/apple-event-mac-october-news-updates-products-scary-fast\">“Scary Fast” event</a> in 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270706/apple-macbook-pro-m4-pro-max-14-16-announcement-specs\">M4-based machines in October</a>, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"phB246\">M3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro</h3>\n\n<p>The entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23944344/apple-macbook-pro-14-2023-review-m3-specs-battery-ports\">14-inch M3 MacBook Pro</a> has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).</p>\n\n<p>The M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.</p>\n\n<p>We’re finding it challenging to find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock, but if you don’t need the extra overhead for multitasking, <a href=\"https://howl.link/elkm1topdfdua\">Best Buy</a> is selling it with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199 ($200 off). The model with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is also on sale for $1,299 ($300 off) at <a href=\"https://howl.link/iq0hgcvmtx5cw\">Best Buy</a>, while the step-up configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is going for $1,399 ($300 off) at <a href=\"https://howl.link/8o3j4fcipypuc\">Best Buy</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23949207/apple-macbook-pro-16-m3-max-review-price-specs\">the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model</a>, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.</p>\n\n<p>But rest assured, versions that actual humans buy now receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,399 ($600 off) at <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1793624-REG/apple_mrx33ll_a_14_macbook_pro_with.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, which is its best price to date.

Notably, the base <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289831/apple-macbook-pro-m4-review-14-2024-laptop-specs-benchmarks\"><strong>14-inch M4 MacBook Pro</strong></a> is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.</p>\n\n<p>The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.</p>\n\n<p>Deals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starts at around $1,395 ($204 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHBYRPS\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859560-REG/apple_mw2u3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, which is an all-time low. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,779 ($220 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY2BJ6\">Amazon</a>, which is one of its better prices to date.</p>\n\n<p>The base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,229 ($260 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-14%E2%80%91core-20%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLHDCN6P\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859574-REG/apple_mx2x3ll_a_16_macbook_pro_m4.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.adorama.com/acmacbk2416.html\">Adorama</a>, which is its typical sale price and $40 more than its lowest price to date.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dJ3cdr\">The best Mac Mini deals</h2>\n\n<p>There’s a new Mac Mini in town, as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283861/apple-redesigned-mac-mini-macbook-pro-imac-m4-photos\">M4-based models arrived late last year</a>. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint on its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cUuNKL\">M4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini</h3>\n\n<p>Deals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24289730/apple-mac-mini-m4-review\">M4 Mac Mini</a> starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599.

Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the odd decision to place the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282752/the-magic-mouse-haters-are-going-to-have-a-field-day-with-this-one\">power button on its underside</a>, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you can get the base Mac Mini at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core/dp/B0DLBTPDCS\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859258-REG/apple_mu9d3ll_a_mac_mini_m4_10c_10cgpu_16gb_256gb.html\">B&amp;H Photo</a> with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $529 ($70 off), its best price to date.

Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13- and 15-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\nRight now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air in its new entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is on sale at B&H Photo and Amazon in select colors starting at $849 ($250 off), which is its best price to date. You can save a bit more at Best Buy if you don’t mind stepping down to 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which will run you $799 ($200 off). You can also find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $999 ($300 off) in select colors at Amazon, which remains its best price to date.\nAs for the 15-inch MacBook Air M3, you can currently grab it with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage in select colors at Amazon starting at $999 ($300 off). Meanwhile, the 16GB / 512GB configuration is available at Best Buy in select colors starting at $1,249 ($250 off).\nM4 MacBook Air\nAlong with an updated Mac Studio, Apple recently announced a new MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with M4 silicon. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro.\nAs of this week, you can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $949 ($50 off) at Amazon (at checkout). My Best Buy Plus and My Best Buy Total members can also get the 13-inch model on sale for $949. \nIf you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 10-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,049 ($50 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, though the latter retailer requires a My Best Buy Plus or Total membership. \nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.\nWe’re finding it challenging to find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock, but if you don’t need the extra overhead for multitasking, Best Buy is selling it with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199 ($200 off). The model with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is also on sale for $1,299 ($300 off) at Best Buy, while the step-up configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is going for $1,399 ($300 off) at Best Buy.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.\nBut rest assured, versions that actual humans buy now receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,399 ($600 off) at B&H Photo, which is its best price to date.  Need more RAM? B&H Photo is also selling it with 36GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for a record low of $1,699 ($600 off).\nAs for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting at Best Buy for $2,099 ($300 off), which is $100 more than its best price to date. Best Buy is also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,399 ($400 off).\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.\nDeals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starts at around $1,395 ($204 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is an all-time low. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,779 ($220 off) at Amazon, which is one of its better prices to date.\nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,229 ($260 off) at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Adorama, which is its typical sale price and $40 more than its lowest price to date.\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThere’s a new Mac Mini in town, as M4-based models arrived late last year. Apple reduced the horizontal footprint on its desktop and paired it with its new M4 chipset and 16GB of RAM, which is double that of the previous generation and brings it in line with other base model Macs from 2024. That makes Apple’s newest desktop computer a tremendous value.\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the newest Mac Mini are a bit easier to come by now than they were at launch, which is good since the outgoing M2 model is becoming more difficult to find. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the last-gen M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\nRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $529 ($70 off), its best price to date. If you need more storage, you can step up to the version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $699 ($100 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is also an all-time low.\nMeanwhile, the base M4 Pro model with 24GB of RAM and 512GB of storage is on sale at Amazon, B&H Photo, and Adorama starting around $1,294 ($106 off), which is $5 more than its all-time low.","summary":"Apple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points.

I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the <em>regular</em> S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257552_Samsung_Galaxy_S25_review_AJohnson_0005.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit <em>much</em>, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oV1Wae\">The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / <strong>Processor:</strong> Snapdragon 8 Elite / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>6,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 80W wired, 50W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP6</em>8 and IP69</em></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257469_OnePlus_13_AJohnson_0003.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;This vegan leather back panel is so nice.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge&nbsp;— and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wTR5JS\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24336534/oneplus-13-review-specs-screen-camera-battery\">Read my OnePlus 13 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SbewYq\">The best foldable phone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>8.0-inch 2076p 120Hz OLED inner screen, 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED cover screen / <strong>Processor:</strong> Tensor G4 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen), 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,650mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IPX8</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Does anyone truly need a folding phone?

But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen.</p>\n\n<p>The 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25607218/DSC08201_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in porcelain.\" title=\"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in porcelain.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The inner screen is great and all, but how about that outer screen?&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>That said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow.

More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.\nRead my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nThe best Android phone that isn’t huge\nScreen: 6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie Battery: 4000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready)   / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nMost people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.\nThat’s the regular S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.\nThe Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit much, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.\nThe best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge\nScreen: 6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 and IP69\nThere are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.\nThe OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.\nRead my OnePlus 13 review.\nThe best foldable phone\nScreen: 8.0-inch 2076p 120Hz OLED inner screen, 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen), 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,650mAh / Charging: 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather resistance: IPX8\nDoes anyone truly need a folding phone? Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen.\nThe 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach.\nThat said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow. For the adventurous early adopter, though, the 9 Pro Fold will be very rewarding.\nRead my Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review.\nOther Android phones worth considering\nThere are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.\nFirst off, there’s the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung’s excellent clamshell-style foldable. It’s not as much fun to use as the 2024 Motorola Razr Plus — which facilitates using apps on the cover screen more easily — but Motorola’s track record for software updates isn’t great, so the Z Flip 6 is a safer bet for a flip phone. Read our review.\nThe OnePlus Open is also another good book-style foldable option. It’s thin and light, and the software includes some thoughtful approaches to multitasking — a crucial part of the folding phone experience. But it won’t be supported with software updates for as long as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Read our review.\nLast but not least, there’s the Google Pixel 8A. If you really want to maximize the return on your investment, it’s hard to beat Google’s latest midrange phone. It’s due for replacement in the near future, but if you can snag a deal on the 8A it’s still a great buy.
