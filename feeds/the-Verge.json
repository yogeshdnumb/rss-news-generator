Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, are planning to reintroduce a bill to sunset Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act in two years. Repealing the bill, <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/exclusive-section-230-may-finally-get-changed-lawmakers-prep-new-bill\">first reported by <em>The Information</em></a>, would remove protections that web services and users have enjoyed since the 1990s, which underpins much of the way the internet as we know it today works. It’s a proposal Graham has been trying to advance <a href=\"https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/graham-introduces-bill-to-incentivize-section-230-reform\">since 2020</a>, and his spokesperson, Taylor Reidy, confirms a reintroduction is “in the works.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation\">Section 230</a> shields any &#8220;interactive computer service&#8221; or its users from legal liability for speech that was produced by someone else — making it possible for social media platforms, as well as blogs and even listserv operators, to moderate content without fearing lengthy litigation over each decision. But critics have argued that it either reduces the incentives for large social networks to police illegal content like abuse and harassment, or, conversely, that it gives these platforms too much freedom to remove content that&#8217;s not illegal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Section 230, and the legal immunity it provides to Big Tech, has been on the books since 1996—long before social media became a part of our daily lives,” Durbin says in a statement. “To the extent this protection was ever needed, its usefulness has long since passed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Section 230 had bipartisan support when it became law in 1996, when the internet was a relatively small part of many people&#8217;s lives. But it’s come under bipartisan fire as the power of tech companies has multiplied and attracted blame for a variety of societal ills. Despite that, it’s been difficult for any single proposal for reform to gain momentum, since the ways that Democrats and Republicans think the law should change has largely fallen along partisan lines. In general, past <a href=\"https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/9/4/946ef55b-5d08-4f72-9ca0-f4394303d5f2/CA92EA4F424BCFD48E816A4153A89380.the-safe-tech-three-pager.pdf%5C\">Democratic proposals</a> have sought to make it easier to hold platforms accountable for harmful content they allow to spread on their services, while <a href=\"https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/9/wicker-graham-blackburn-introduce-bill-to-modify-section-230-and-empower-consumers-online\">Republican proposals</a> have sought to punish platforms for restricting certain kinds of content.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea of sunsetting Section 230 is not new — Graham <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/5020/text\">introduced a bill to repeal the law</a> back in late 2020. When he <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2972/cosponsors\">reintroduced it in 2021</a>, it had two Republican co-sponsors. But introducing a repeal with the backing of a prominent Democrat could give the proposal new status and momentum. The top bipartisan lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee <a href=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/energy-and-commerce-leaders-unveil-bipartisan-draft-legislation-to-sunset-section-230\">floated something similar</a> last year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324276/kids-online-safety-act-parent-advocates\">even with bipartisan support, passing any tech legislation</a> has lately proved to be a Sisyphean task. That&#8217;s on top of a constitutional crisis that has thrown Congress&#8217; power into question and raised the possibility that the Trump administration could <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/policy/624974/take-it-down-act-deepfakes-nonconsensual-pornography-trump-constitutional-crisis\">abuse or selectively enforce any new law</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Even with bipartisan support, passing any tech legislation has lately proved to be a Sisyphean task</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The theory behind a repeal of 230 is that it will force Congress (and industry lobbyists) to renegotiate if they want to retain any of the protections it provided. Graham <a href=\"https://www.lgraham.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2020/12/graham-introduces-bill-to-incentivize-section-230-reform\">said in a 2020 statement</a> that the bill would give Congress “two years to find an acceptable alternative or allow the legal liability protections to go away.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nongovernmental Section 230 critics like Digital Content Next, which represents publishers including <em>The Verge’s</em> parent company Vox Media, see value in putting pressure on tech companies to engage in solutions, rather than reject attempts at reform outright. &#8220;The beauty of the sunset bill is, I think it would bring platforms to the table in a more thoughtful way,” says Chris Pedigo, DCN’s SVP of government affairs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I’m under no illusion that it will be easy to pass legislation to protect kids online and finally make the tech industry legally accountable for the harms they cause, like every other industry in America,” Durbin says in his statement. “But I hope that for the sake of our nation’s kids, Congress finally acts.”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Congress’ least favorite law is once against facing an existential challenge by bipartisan opponents. \nSens.

But critics have argued that it either reduces the incentives for large social networks to police illegal content like abuse and harassment, or, conversely, that it gives these platforms too much freedom to remove content that’s not illegal.\n“Section 230, and the legal immunity it provides to Big Tech, has been on the books since 1996—long before social media became a part of our daily lives,” Durbin says in a statement. “To the extent this protection was ever needed, its usefulness has long since passed.”\nSection 230 had bipartisan support when it became law in 1996, when the internet was a relatively small part of many people’s lives. But it’s come under bipartisan fire as the power of tech companies has multiplied and attracted blame for a variety of societal ills. Despite that, it’s been difficult for any single proposal for reform to gain momentum, since the ways that Democrats and Republicans think the law should change has largely fallen along partisan lines. In general, past Democratic proposals have sought to make it easier to hold platforms accountable for harmful content they allow to spread on their services, while Republican proposals have sought to punish platforms for restricting certain kinds of content.\nThe idea of sunsetting Section 230 is not new — Graham introduced a bill to repeal the law back in late 2020. When he reintroduced it in 2021, it had two Republican co-sponsors. But introducing a repeal with the backing of a prominent Democrat could give the proposal new status and momentum. The top bipartisan lawmakers on the House Energy and Commerce Committee floated something similar last year.\nBut even with bipartisan support, passing any tech legislation has lately proved to be a Sisyphean task. That’s on top of a constitutional crisis that has thrown Congress’ power into question and raised the possibility that the Trump administration could abuse or selectively enforce any new law.\n\nEven with bipartisan support, passing any tech legislation has lately proved to be a Sisyphean task\n\n\nThe theory behind a repeal of 230 is that it will force Congress (and industry lobbyists) to renegotiate if they want to retain any of the protections it provided. Graham said in a 2020 statement that the bill would give Congress “two years to find an acceptable alternative or allow the legal liability protections to go away.”\nNongovernmental Section 230 critics like Digital Content Next, which represents publishers including The Verge’s parent company Vox Media, see value in putting pressure on tech companies to engage in solutions, rather than reject attempts at reform outright. “The beauty of the sunset bill is, I think it would bring platforms to the table in a more thoughtful way,” says Chris Pedigo, DCN’s SVP of government affairs.\n“I’m under no illusion that it will be easy to pass legislation to protect kids online and finally make the tech industry legally accountable for the harms they cause, like every other industry in America,” Durbin says in his statement. “But I hope that for the sake of our nation’s kids, Congress finally acts.”","summary":"Congress&#8217; least favorite law is once against facing an existential challenge by bipartisan opponents.&#160; Sens.

It’s great to see faster wireless charging, but it does mean you’re again incentivized to buy Apple’s puck over cheaper, more widely available Qi2 options.</p>\n\n<p>For once, there’s good reason to consider the Apple puck. It’s Qi2-certified as well as MagSafe, so it’ll work with non-Apple Qi2 devices should those materialize. And the company has <em>finally</em> added a version with a 2m / 6.6ft cable instead of only offering a too-short 1m / 3.3ft one. Get the longer one. You’ll also need an AC adapter since it doesn’t come with one. Both <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65\">Anker</a> and Nomad, among others, have options that are smaller and cheaper than Apple’s USB-C chargers.

If you just want a basic puck, we like Anker’s MagGo Qi2 wireless charging pad. Its five-foot cable is shorter than the 6.6-foot one on Apple’s new MagSafe charger, but it’s also $20 cheaper. When you consider that Anker includes an AC adapter and Apple doesn’t, it’s more like $40 cheaper.

It folds up flat and compact enough to easily slip into a bag or carry-on pocket, and it includes a 45W power plug with prong adapters that cover most of the globe. Its aluminum and faux-leather construction is also substantial enough, and its design elevated enough, to be the main 3-in-1 charger on your desk once you’re back home.

The latest version fixes some of our minor grievances from its predecessors while adopting the Qi2 standard. It now uses an included 36W USB-C power adapter instead of a gigantic plug with a barrel connector, and the elevated Qi2 mount can tilt your phone in a variety of angles.

Can it charge more than one device?\n\n\n\n\n\nPortability\nDoes the charger travel easily, or is it best left in one spot to never move?\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nIs it janky or refined? Does it have clever design elements or bonus features?\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nDoes this charger offer a better value than most, or at least justify its price?\n\n\nBest for iPhone 16 and 16 Pro\nCertification: MagSafe, Qi2 / Wireless charge output: 25W (iPhone 16), 15W (Qi2) / Cable length: 6.6ft / 2m / Connector type: USB-C / AC adapter included: no / Warranty: One year\nWhile Qi2 is as fast as MagSafe on the iPhones 12 through 15, Apple has moved the goalposts with the iPhone 16 generation. The new phones can charge at up to 25W with the updated MagSafe Charger — making it the best choice for owners of the latest iPhone. It’s great to see faster wireless charging, but it does mean you’re again incentivized to buy Apple’s puck over cheaper, more widely available Qi2 options.\nFor once, there’s good reason to consider the Apple puck. It’s Qi2-certified as well as MagSafe, so it’ll work with non-Apple Qi2 devices should those materialize. And the company has finally added a version with a 2m / 6.6ft cable instead of only offering a too-short 1m / 3.3ft one. Get the longer one. You’ll also need an AC adapter since it doesn’t come with one. Both Anker and Nomad, among others, have options that are smaller and cheaper than Apple’s USB-C chargers. Nomad’s, in particular, has a nice, flat design.\n— Antonio G. Di Benedetto\nBest Qi2 charging puck overall\nCertification: Qi2 / Wireless charge output: 15W / Cable length: 5ft / 1.5m / Connector type: USB-C / AC adapter included: Yes, optional / Warranty: Two years\nAny Qi2-certified charger will charge any MagSafe iPhone at 15W (except for the iPhone 12 Mini and 13 Mini, which top out at 12W). If you just want a basic puck, we like Anker’s MagGo Qi2 wireless charging pad. Its five-foot cable is shorter than the 6.6-foot one on Apple’s new MagSafe charger, but it’s also $20 cheaper. When you consider that Anker includes an AC adapter and Apple doesn’t, it’s more like $40 cheaper. Unless you have an iPhone 16 and really want that 25W charging, the Anker Qi2 puck is a better value.\n— Antonio G. Di Benedetto\nBest Qi2 3-in-1 charger for travel\nCertification: Qi2 / Wireless charge output: 15W / Apple Watch fast charging: Yes / Cable length: 5ft / 1.5m / Connector type: USB-C / AC adapter included: Yes / Warranty: One year\nThe Satechi 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand makes a great travel charger for people who hit the road with an iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods. It folds up flat and compact enough to easily slip into a bag or carry-on pocket, and it includes a 45W power plug with prong adapters that cover most of the globe. Its aluminum and faux-leather construction is also substantial enough, and its design elevated enough, to be the main 3-in-1 charger on your desk once you’re back home. (There’s also a 2-in-1 version without the Apple Watch charger, which is similarly nice but doesn’t come with an AC adapter.)\nHonorable mention:\nCertification: Qi2 / Wireless charge output: 15W / Apple Watch fast charging: Yes / Cable length: 5ft / 1.5m / Connector type: USB-C / AC adapter included: Yes / Warranty: Two years\nAnker’s folding 3-in-1 is smaller and more compact than the Satechi — it’s more like a bar of soap than a bar of chocolate — but it doesn’t include prong adapters. Also, its lighter build makes it easy to accidentally pick up the whole charger when you just meant to grab your phone and gives it more limited articulation for home desktop use. It’s best suited for frequent travelers who don’t want to pack up their home charger before every trip.\n— Antonio G. Di Benedetto\nBest Qi2 3-in-1 stand for home\nCertification: Qi2 / Wireless charge output: 15W / Apple Watch fast charging: Yes / Cable length: about 5ft / 1.5m (permanently attached) / Connector type: USB-C / AC adapter included: Yes / Warranty: Two years\nOnce again, the Belkin “tree” towers over all others when it comes to a 3-in-1 for home use. The latest version fixes some of our minor grievances from its predecessors while adopting the Qi2 standard. It now uses an included 36W USB-C power adapter instead of a gigantic plug with a barrel connector, and the elevated Qi2 mount can tilt your phone in a variety of angles. Its nylon-wrapped USB-C cable isn’t detachable, but at least it’s about five feet long.\n— Antonio G. Di Benedetto\nBest Qi2 desk charger\nCertification: Qi2 / Wireless charge output: 15W / Cable length: about 5ft / 1.5m / Connector type: 12V AC / AC adapter included: Attached / Warranty: Two years\nStaff opinions on this orb are, frankly, divided, but I had it on my desk for a while, and after I sent it back, I missed it enough that I bought one. This Death Star-looking thing has a Qi2 pad on the front and two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, and three AC outlets on the back, with up to 67W charging between them. Fully utilized, yeah, it’s gonna look like a cable octopus, but it’s nice to have something in arm’s reach that can charge your phone, your laptop, and whatever else you’ve got going on.\n— Nathan Edwards\nBest Qi2 battery pack\nCertification: Qi2 / Wireless charge output: up to 15W / Cell capacity: 25.41Wh (6,600mAh) / Connector type: USB-C / Warranty: Two years\nThis folding Qi2 battery pack doubles as a phone stand and has 6,600mAh capacity, which is more than enough to fully charge even an iPhone 16 Pro Max. You can also charge from its USB-C port if you prefer. It’s not the slimmest Qi2 battery, but it’s sturdy enough to hold the phone in landscape mode without toppling, which is nice.\n— Nathan Edwards\nRead our hands-on with the Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K).\nBest Qi2 car mount\nCertification: Qi2 / Wireless charge output: 15W / Cable length: 3.3ft / 1m / Connector type: USB-C / AC adapter included: No / Warranty: One year\nThe Verge’s Thomas Ricker and I both like this compact Qi2 car charger. It can be either vent- or dash-mounted, and it’s inexpensive, though you’ll have to supply your own USB-C power adapter. I bought the “CryoBoost” version, which has a cooling fan, since I live in sweltering Texas. And since my car is ancient and my old Bluetooth FM transmitter’s USB port couldn’t power the Qi2 pad, I also got this 60W FM transmitter / USB-C charger thing. It plugs into the 12V (the “cigarette lighter”) port and has an integrated coiled 30W USB-C cable, which I use for the ESR Qi2 charger, plus another 30W USB-C PD port, a USB-A port, and the aforementioned Bluetooth FM transmitter. Honestly, a killer deal. \nThere are a ton of Qi2 car mounts out there, and we have a few more in the queue, but this one’s good!\n— Nathan Edwards\nRead our full review of the ESR Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Car Charger.\nOther chargers worth considering\nNow that Qi2 is widely available, it’s a safe bet that you’re at least getting something decent if it’s Qi2-certified and it’s from a reputable brand. While our best-ofs above don’t cover every single make and model of charger out there, we’re frequently testing units from the likes of Anker, Belkin, Casetify, Mophie, Nomad, Satechi, Ugreen, Peak Design, Zens, Sharge, and ESR. If there’s a Qi2 charger from one of them that seems like a good fit for your particular needs and your budget, it’s likely worth a shot. When in doubt, know the retailer’s return policy and the manufacturer’s warranty if it ends up not being to your liking.\nUpdate, March 21st: Adjusted pricing / availability and removed the Anker 313 magnetic charger that’s no longer available. Also added a mention of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series and its “Qi2 Ready” status in the intro, as well as ESR’s “CryoBoost” charger in the Best Qi2 car mount section.","summary":"Wireless charging is less efficient than plugging in a wire, but it’s certainly convenient — especially when you add magnets.

But that’s often what our deal hunters at&nbsp;<em>The Verge&nbsp;</em>are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLXMVMV\">10th-gen iPad of 2022</a> to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M3 and M4 chips.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CM2y8j\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\">iPad (2022)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\"><strong>10th-gen iPad</strong></a> came out in late 2022. It’s still a terrific tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">Apple’s latest entry-level model</a>, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>\n\n<p>In the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2022-Apple-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Blue-10th-Generation/1485722187\">Walmart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1731146-REG/apple_mpq13ll_a_10_9_ipad_10th_gen.html/\">B&amp;H Photo</a> in select colors starting around $269 ($80 off), which is $20 more than its best price to date. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLBNNRT/\">Amazon</a>, meanwhile, is selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for $395 ($70 off), which is a new low.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-2025-deals\">The best iPad (2025) deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As noted above, <strong>Apple’s 11th-gen iPad</strong> just recently landed on the scene. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">new base-model tablet</a> is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is supposedly nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip is not Apple’s propriety silicon, though, and as such, it doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We don’t expect those prices to drop significantly in the coming months, though, if you choose to be an early adopter, the entry-level configuration with 128GB of storage is currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77D5HL/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2025-Apple-11-inch-iPad-A16-Built-for-Apple-Intelligence-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue/15445159390\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/4muifjvdbxao1\">Best Buy</a> starting at around $329 ($20 off). Amazon is also selling the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ773FRV/\">256GB model for $425</a> ($24 off) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ77RHLL/\">512GB variant for $602</a> ($47 off), if you need more storage.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"njqbEo\">The best <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24268079/apple-ipad-mini-2024-specs-price\">iPad Mini (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>The new <strong>seventh-gen iPad Mini</strong> is similar to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review\">the outgoing model</a> but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.</p>\n\n<p>The 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering&nbsp;if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, you can get the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3W6TV6/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/brey8lnafmh1a\">Best Buy</a> starting at $399 ($100 off), which matches its best price to date. You can also get the 256GB variant at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XM94S/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/13248266895\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/xxn32gkvw6k6x\">Best Buy</a> for $499 ($100 off) or the 512GB model at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3XT3DX/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/13267717105\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/ozz6g732vwqk2\">Best Buy</a> for $699 (also $100 off), which matches the lowest price we’ve seen on either configuration.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-air-2024-deals\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024\">best iPad Air (2024)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p>Although the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24155407/apple-ipad-air-review-2024\"><strong>2024 iPad Air</strong></a> isn’t vastly different from the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/623027/apple-ipad-air-2025-launch-price-specs\">new M3 model</a>, it was the first Air available in a 13-inch configuration in addition to an 11-inch base model. Apple also introduced Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, enabling the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the last-gen Air with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24146454/apple-pencil-pro-ipad-stylus-price-availability-features\">Apple Pencil Pro</a> and latest Magic Keyboard, too, and while it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s tablet slate, both the 11- and 13-inch Air are still readily available starting at $599 and $799, respectively.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of discounts, you can currently pick up the 11-inch base model at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2024-Apple-11-inch-iPad-Air-M2-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray/5767360699\">Walmart</a> with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi starting at $499 ($100 off) — a price that matches its all-time low. As for the 13-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J5XNCT\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://howl.link/nlyvxsx84kx44\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/2024-Apple-11-inch-iPad-Air-M2-Wi-Fi-128GB-Blue/5769320662\">Walmart</a> are all selling it in select colors starting at around $698 ($101 off), which is $5 more than its lowest price to date.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-ipad-air-2025-deals\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/626647/apple-ipad-air-review-2025\">best iPad Air (2025)</a> deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>2025 iPad Air</strong> is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air.

The day-to-day discounts may come and go like changing winds, but there’s often something to be saved, particularly on the more affordable iPads. The most recent iPad Pro and iPad Mini are also regularly discounted, and you can even save a bit on Apple’s latest iPad Air.\n \n\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\n\nIt’s difficult to know where exactly you can find the most notable iPad deals unless you’re scouring the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at The Verge are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals you can get on each iPad model that is currently available, from the 10th-gen iPad of 2022 to the latest models equipped with Apple’s powerful M3 and M4 chips.\nThe best iPad (2022) deals\nApple’s 10th-gen iPad came out in late 2022. It’s still a terrific tablet overall; however, it’s recently been supplanted by Apple’s latest entry-level model, which features an upgraded A16 chip and twice as much base storage. That said, the last-gen iPad still benefits from a modern design and Apple’s long-in-the-making switch to USB-C. The 10.9-inch tablet is also outfitted with a side power button with a fingerprint sensor and uniform bezels, though, unlike its predecessor, it lacks a home button and a 3.5mm headphone jack.\nIn the past, you could often buy Apple’s latest entry-level iPad for $349 ($100 off its initial launch price) — which is now the MSRP. Right now, however, the base model with 64GB of storage is on sale at Walmart and B&H Photo in select colors starting around $269 ($80 off), which is $20 more than its best price to date. Amazon, meanwhile, is selling the 256GB model with Wi-Fi for $395 ($70 off), which is a new low.\nThe best iPad (2025) deals\nAs noted above, Apple’s 11th-gen iPad just recently landed on the scene. The new base-model tablet is a fairly iterative update of the prior model with 128GB of base storage (as opposed to 64GB) and an A16 Bionic chip, which is supposedly nearly 30 percent faster than the A14 chip found in the 10th-gen iPad. The newer chip is not Apple’s propriety silicon, though, and as such, it doesn’t support the various Apple Intelligence features introduced in iPadOS 18.1. For that, you’ll want to opt for a more recent iPad Air, iPad Mini, or iPad Pro model.\nPricing-wise, the new iPad starts at $349 with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage. You can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB of storage for an additional $100 or $200, respectively, or purchase an LTE model starting at $499. We don’t expect those prices to drop significantly in the coming months, though, if you choose to be an early adopter, the entry-level configuration with 128GB of storage is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at around $329 ($20 off). Amazon is also selling the 256GB model for $425 ($24 off) and the 512GB variant for $602 ($47 off), if you need more storage.\nThe best iPad Mini (2024) deals\nThe new seventh-gen iPad Mini is similar to the outgoing model but comes with faster Wi-Fi and USB-C speeds, support for the Apple Pencil Pro, and a newer A17 Pro processor with 8GB of RAM to support Apple Intelligence. Otherwise, it boasts nearly identical specs and features as the last-gen model, meaning it has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, a USB-C port, and options for 5G. It may not be worth upgrading if you already own a sixth-gen Mini, but newcomers to the category will appreciate the upgrades.\nThe 2024 iPad Mini starts at $499 with 128GB of storage, which was the price for the previous generation’s 64GB model. Electing for 256GB of storage brings the price up to $599, and the cellular models start at $649. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want an Apple tablet in the smallest possible form factor, this is where the action is.\nRight now, you can get the 128GB base model with Wi-Fi at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $399 ($100 off), which matches its best price to date. You can also get the 256GB variant at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $499 ($100 off) or the 512GB model at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $699 (also $100 off), which matches the lowest price we’ve seen on either configuration.\nThe best iPad Air (2024) deals\nAlthough the 2024 iPad Air isn’t vastly different from the new M3 model, it was the first Air available in a 13-inch configuration in addition to an 11-inch base model. Apple also introduced Wi-Fi 6E radios and upgraded the chipset to M2, enabling the hover feature when using Apple’s latest styluses. You can use the last-gen Air with the Apple Pencil Pro and latest Magic Keyboard, too, and while it’s no longer officially a part of Apple’s tablet slate, both the 11- and 13-inch Air are still readily available starting at $599 and $799, respectively.\nIn terms of discounts, you can currently pick up the 11-inch base model at Walmart with 128GB of storage and Wi-Fi starting at $499 ($100 off) — a price that matches its all-time low. As for the 13-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage, Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart are all selling it in select colors starting at around $698 ($101 off), which is $5 more than its lowest price to date.\nThe best iPad Air (2025) deals\nThe 2025 iPad Air is little more than a spec bump over the previous model, with a few technical upgrades that should allow it to last longer than both the entry-level iPad and the last-gen Air. It features an M3 chip with support for Apple Intelligence and compatibility with Apple’s latest Magic Keyboard, which has a larger trackpad and an extra row of function keys that makes the Air a more credible laptop replacement. \nThe 11-inch model starts at $599 and the 13-inch variant $799 — the same price as the previous models — but we’re already starting to see discounts from third-party retailers. Right now, for instance, the 11-inch Air is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy in its base configuration with Wi-Fi and 128GB of storage starting at $549 ($50 off). Amazon also has the 256GB model for $649 ($50 off) and the 512GB model starting at $847 ($52 off), which is the lowest price we’ve seen on both configurations.\nThe larger 13-inch model, meanwhile, is currently on sale at Amazon with 128GB of storage starting at $745 ($54 off) or at B&H Photo or Best Buy for $749 ($50 off). You can also pick up the Wi-Fi / 256GB model at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo for $849 ($100 off), or the 512GB variant at Amazon and Best Buy for an all-time low of $1,049.\nThe best iPad Pro (2024) deals\nCompared to the latest iPad Air, the 2024 iPad Pro is a far more impressive upgrade. The 11- and 13-inch models start at $999 and $1,299, respectively, and they are the first Apple devices to feature the company’s latest M4 chip, which brings moderate performance gains and dedicated hardware for on-device Apple Intelligence processing.
