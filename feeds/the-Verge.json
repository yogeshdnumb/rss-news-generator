A blog post published with today’s announcement reveals another tidbit or two, but for the rest of the answers we’ll have to tune in on Monday.\nSamsung isn’t being coy about what it’s announcing: it’s definitely the Galaxy S25 Edge. The blog post comes right out and names the device, saying it “…not only sets a new standard for what you can achieve with your smartphone, but it also unlocks a new era of growth for the mobile industry.” That would be great news for an industry that has seen slumping sales over the past few years. Also noted in the blog post: despite its slim profile, the S25 Edge will come with a 200-megapixel main camera, like the top-of-the-line Galaxy S25 Ultra does.\nThat suggests the S25 Edge will clock in as more of a premium device than Apple’s rumored slim phone might be. The iPhone 17 Air could come with a single rear camera and a mix of high and low-end features. The S25 Edge, according to Samsung, will merge “flagship-level performance with superior portability.”\nSo what does a flagship-level slim phone that’s supposedly going to set the ailing mobile industry on fire cost? And where will it be sold? Recent rumors pointed to a delayed US launch. It wouldn’t be too surprising to see the phone launch first in South Korea, though the fact that Samsung US is offering a $50 credit to those who reserve the phone now bodes well for us. At least one thing looks certain: we won’t have to keep guessing for much longer. The virtual event will stream in plenty of places, including Samsung’s YouTube channel.","summary":"Samsung will formally unveil the Galaxy S25 Edge during a virtual Unpacked event on Monday, May 12th at 8PM ET. This answers at least one of our many questions about Samsung’s upcoming slim phone which the company teased back in January.
