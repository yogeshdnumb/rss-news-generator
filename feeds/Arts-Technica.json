NASA's most recent estimate has the likelihood of a strike increasing to 3.2 percent. Now that's not particularly high, but it's also not zero.\nNaturally the prospect of a large ball of rock tens of meters across striking the planet is a little worrisome. This is large enough to cause localized devastation near its impact site, likely on the order of the Tunguska event of 1908, which leveled some 500 square miles (1,287 square kilometers) of forest in remote Siberia.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Eric Berger\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/the-odds-of-a-city-killer-asteroid-impact-in-2032-keep-rising-should-we-be-worried/#comments","content":"\n            \"Humanity has never tried to stop an asteroid impact for real.\"\n          ","contentSnippet":"\"Humanity has never tried to stop an asteroid impact for real.\"","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/the-odds-of-a-city-killer-asteroid-impact-in-2032-keep-rising-should-we-be-worried/","categories":["Space","2024 YR4","asteroid","space"],"isoDate":"2025-02-19T14:36:03.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jonathan M.
