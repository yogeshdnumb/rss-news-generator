And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below. </p>\n\n<p>But even if you’re looking for something a little more <em>extra</em>, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24237586/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-screen-camera-battery\">feels like the right size and shape</a>, flip phones offer <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24191156/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review-screen-battery-camera\">a lot more than just nostalgia</a>, and you can still buy a phone with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery\">no fewer than four cameras on the back</a>. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/20/23730130/apple-iphone-13-mini-apple-phones\">it’s how I bought mine</a>. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we test phones</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23775534/switch-phones-ios-android-iphone-google-pixel-samsung-esim\">so routine that it’s mostly painless</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Top-notch software support</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">The phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A fantastic camera</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Most phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Best-in-class build quality</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">The very best devices come with robust IP68 ratings, durable glass on the front and back, and sturdy aluminum exterior frames.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Value</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">In addition to the very best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>If you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500. For those recommendations, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap\">check out our guide to budget smartphones</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dctrOj\">The best iPhone for most people</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen:&nbsp;</strong>6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 OLED, 60Hz refresh rate /&nbsp;<strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;A18&nbsp;<strong>Cameras:</strong>&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;<strong>Battery:&nbsp;</strong>Not advertised /&nbsp;<strong>Charging:</strong>&nbsp;27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi /&nbsp;<strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong>&nbsp;IP68</em></em></p>\n\n<p>From a hardware perspective, the iPhone 16 (or the 16 Plus) is an easy upgrade choice. If you’re switching from an iPhone 13, 12, or even older, those four or five years of incremental performance improvements add up. But there’s something entirely new this time around — well, two things: the Action Button and the Camera Control button.</p>\n\n<p>The customizable <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246068/apple-iphone-16-pro-action-button-ios-shortcuts-uses-examples\">Action Button</a>, which replaces the mute switch on the left edge of the phone, is a hand-me-down from the 15 Pro series. You can set it to open a particular app, turn on the flashlight, or almost anything else you might want at the touch of a button. On the other side of the phone is the Camera Control, which you can use to launch the camera app. With the camera open, it acts as a shutter button with a full press, and a light press brings up other exposure options you can adjust. Even if you only ever use it to launch the camera, it’s pretty handy, and it frees up the Action Button.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25626683/DSC08407.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"iPhone 16 in blue and iPhone 16 Plus in pink.\" title=\"iPhone 16 in blue and iPhone 16 Plus in pink.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 16 Plus (left) and its smaller sibling, the iPhone 16 (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>The iPhone 16 and its larger 16 Plus sibling use Apple’s A18 chipset, which is in the same family as the 16 Pro’s processor. That bodes well for the phones staying on the same software upgrade cycle. They both received Apple Intelligence in the fall, which included AI-powered writing tools and notification summaries in its earliest iteration, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji\">eventually grew to support ChatGPT</a> and a new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240094/apple-visual-intelligence-camera-control-iphone-16-ai-camera-control-google-lens\">Visual Intelligence</a> feature. But despite the similarities, the regular 16 models lag behind the Pros in two important departments: the screen and the camera.</p>\n\n<p>The Pros come with dedicated 5x lenses and updated main cameras that do a little better in low light. And you’ll only get a ProMotion display on the Pro models; the regular 16 features a slower 60Hz screen. Basically every other high-end phone on the market offers a 120Hz display, so that’s a disappointment. If those two drawbacks don’t bother you — and most people probably won’t mind them — then the iPhone 16 makes for a great upgrade.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"CS51M3\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24247479/apple-iphone-16-plus-review-camera-control-screen-battery\">Read our full iPhone 16 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8dgZOb\">The best Android phone for most people</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / <strong>Processor: </strong>Tensor G4 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 10.5-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,700mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 27W wired, 15W wireless (with Pixel Stand 2) / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Android ecosystem has been looking for a phone like the Pixel 9 for a while now.

It doesn’t have a dedicated telephoto lens, which the similarly priced <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera\">Galaxy S25</a> does, but the software is less quirky than Samsung’s, making for a better overall experience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25596780/DSC08136.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Google Pixel 9 on a pink and green background.\" title=\"Google Pixel 9 on a pink and green background.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 9 is Google’s most polished flagship yet.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>Outside of zoom capabilities, Google’s Pixel camera is just as reliable as ever. The phone comes with a Tensor G4 chipset that powers AI features aplenty, both inside and outside of the camera app. Some are promising and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24224084/google-pixel-9-reimagine-ai-photos\">some are worrying</a>, but there’s nothing here that feels like a true game-changer. Which is fine.</p>\n\n<p>The important thing is that the Pixel 9 has the right stuff where it counts. It’s easy to use, and some of the Pixel series’ persistent problems like poor thermals and buggy software seem to be under control in this generation. The 9 Pro is a worthwhile upgrade if you want that telephoto lens and a slightly nicer screen, but in any case, the Pixel 9 feels like a top-notch device, inside and out.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"eghJST\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24232480/google-pixel-9-review-screen-camera-battery\">Read our full Pixel 9 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Ni1mou\">The best high-end Android phone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.9-inch, 1440p, 120Hz OLED / <strong>Processor: </strong>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>5,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 45W wired, 15W wireless, Qi2 ready / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IP68</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Samsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/DSC09399_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>This year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"EheSxn\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/604154/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-ai-screen-battery\">Read my full Galaxy S25 Ultra review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4pE1nB\">The best phone for around $500</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen:&nbsp;</strong>6.1-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz /&nbsp;<strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Tensor G3&nbsp;<strong>Cameras:</strong>&nbsp;64-megapixel f/1.89 with OIS; 13-megapixel ultrawide; 13-megapixel selfie /&nbsp;<strong>Battery:&nbsp;</strong>4,492mAh /&nbsp;<strong>Charging:</strong>&nbsp;18W wired, 7.5W wireless /&nbsp;<strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong>&nbsp;IP67</em></em></p>\n\n<p>It’s hard to beat the Pixel 8A on sheer ROI. For $500, you get a very good budget phone that comes with seven years of OS and security updates; most phones at this price will only see a handful of OS upgrades, if that. The 8A also comes with a good camera that covers the basics. It’s not as fancy as the Pixel 9 or 9 Pro, but it won’t prevent you from capturing that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24154473/google-pixel-8a-camera-hands-on\">once-in-a-lifetime shot</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25451804/DSC07451_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Google Pixel 8A showing home screen.\" title=\"Google Pixel 8A showing home screen.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 8A comes with a 120Hz screen, which is a notable step up from its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>The Pixel 8A provides a lot of other things you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a $500 phone, like wireless charging and an IP67 rating for resistance against full water immersion. Of course, you can’t have everything. The 8A’s back panel is matte plastic rather than glass, sadly, and its 6.1-inch 1080p screen isn’t the best in its class.</p>\n\n<p>There are other phones available for under $500 worth considering, many of which are covered in our guide to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap\">the best inexpensive phones</a>.

In the 15 series, that longer telephoto lens was reserved for the bigger Pro Max model. This time around, it’s on the smaller Pro, too, making it a great option for someone who wants to upgrade without upsizing their phone.</p>\n\n<p>Like the Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro uses an A18 Pro chipset designed to support Apple Intelligence, which <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24272995/apple-intelligence-now-available-ios-18-1-mac-ipad\">started rolling out in the fall of 2024</a>. The first update included things like notification summaries and the new glowing-border Siri UI, which Apple centered its launch event on. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24317119/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-chatgpt-genmoji\">Subsequent updates</a> brought ChatGPT integration and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24240094/apple-visual-intelligence-camera-control-iphone-16-ai-camera-control-google-lens\">Visual Intelligence</a>.

The new Camera Control makes it easier to launch the camera and get right to taking photos, and it also frees up the Action Button if you were using it as a camera shortcut. The screen is a little bigger at 6.3 inches compared to 6.1 inches, even though the phone is basically the same size. You can record 4K video at 120fps now. And the new Photographic Styles, which are available on all iPhone 16 models, let you take more control over your photos than ever.</p>\n\n<p>There’s nothing here that someone with an iPhone 15 Pro should upgrade for, but it’s an all-around solid device that will please Apple devotees, especially those who prefer a phone that isn’t too big.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"63WdF8\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24247538/apple-iphone-16-pro-review\">Read our full iPhone 16 Pro review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"kSVtiN\">The best flip phone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 3.4-inch, 720p, OLED cover screen / <strong>Processor:</strong> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 25W wired, 15W wireless / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IP48</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 isn’t the most <em>fun</em> flip phone you can buy right now; that would be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24191156/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review-screen-battery-camera\">the 2024 Motorola Razr Plus</a>. But fun only goes so far, and the Z Flip 6 is the more reliable of the two. When it comes to the device you use day in and day out, reliability counts for a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Motorola’s take on the modern flip phone embraces nostalgia with cute animations and a mode that sends the whole device back to the early 2000s. The Z Flip 6 lacks this kind of charm, but you do get an updated cover screen UI that’s more customizable than the Z Flip 5’s. The Flip 6 also comes with seven years of software updates, which matches the best software policies on the market. The hardware will probably give out long before the software, honestly.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25639094/DSC07931_alt.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.712909131789,100,78.574181736421\" alt=\"Photo of Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 on green and purple background showing cover screen.\" title=\"Photo of Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 on green and purple background showing cover screen.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The outer screen is handy for quickly starting up a podcast and controlling media.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>That’s the other side of the flip phone coin: long-term durability is iffy. Sure, the Flip 6 is built to withstand full water immersion, but it still doesn’t have any formal dust resistance. For that reason, it isn’t a phone I would recommend to just anyone.</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Z Flip 6’s outer screen does come in handy. You can do a lot with the prebaked widget options available to use, and if you’re just a little adventurous, you can run any app you want on the little screen. Starting a Strava workout or sending a quick text is a cinch, which is a big part of the appeal of a flip phone. Just, you know, keep this phone away from the beach.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"UciFjs\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211507/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review-screen-battery-camera\">Read my full Galaxy Z Flip 6 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"PiiTyN\">The best folding phone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen:&nbsp;</strong>8.0-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.3-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen /&nbsp;<strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Tensor G4 /&nbsp;<strong>Cameras:</strong>&nbsp;48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera /&nbsp;<strong>Battery:&nbsp;</strong>4,650mAh /&nbsp;<strong>Charging:</strong>&nbsp;21W wired, 7.5W wireless /&nbsp;<strong>Weather resistance:</strong>&nbsp;IPX8</em></em></p>\n\n<p>It’s hard to convey just how <em>nice</em> the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is to use. It’s the first book-style folding phone that fully delivers on the promise of a foldable: it’s a tablet when you need it and a regular phone when you don’t.</p>\n\n<p>Samsung’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24204714/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-screen-battery-camera\">Z Fold series feels a little too narrow</a> and cramped in its closed configuration, and the original <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23773594/google-pixel-fold-review-screen-battery-hinge-camera\">Pixel Fold</a> was too bulky and heavy to use comfortably. The 9 Pro Fold is lighter, and using its 6.3-inch outer screen feels basically like using a normal phone, which is a big win.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25607218/DSC08201_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in porcelain.\" title=\"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in porcelain.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;Using the 9 Pro Fold’s outer screen feels like using a normal phone.

But there are a couple of decidedly not-normal things to consider: price and durability. The 9 Pro Fold costs $1,799 — basically the going rate for a book-style foldable but still a lot of money for a phone.</p>\n\n<p>And long-term durability is unclear, especially given that this is only Google’s second folding phone. It’s rated to withstand full water immersion, but as with any foldable, dust is a concern, so you’ll want to take a little extra care with this device. All that said, someone with the stomach (and wallet) for the 9 Pro Fold will find it a very rewarding device.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"rsSZIW\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24237586/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-screen-camera-battery\">Read my full Pixel 9 Pro Fold review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"2iWVqx\">The best phone for something completely different</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED / <strong>Processor: </strong>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel F/1.9 main with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 32-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,700mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 45W wired, 15W wireless / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IP54</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Nothing Phone 2 isn’t for everyone, but for the right kind of person, it’s a very good alternative to the Galaxies and Pixels of the world. It’s a style-driven device, from the dot-matrix-inspired UI to the flashing light strips on the back panel. Will its unique hardware and software features help you take back your attention span as Nothing claims? Eh, probably not. Mostly, it’s just a cool-looking gadget and a thoughtfully designed device.</p>\n\n<p>The Phone 2 is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset, which is a slightly older but still very capable processor. Its 6.7-inch, 1080p screen supports a fast 120Hz top refresh rate, and its lowest 1Hz refresh rate allows it to offer an information-rich always-on display. The camera system is good, though not quite as consistent as the Pixel 7’s. There’s wireless charging, fast 45W wired charging, and an all-day battery.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24785448/DSC04957_processed.JPG?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Nothing Phone 2 on a table showing home screen.\" title=\"Nothing Phone 2 on a table showing home screen.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The dot-matrix theme is carried out through the entire interface.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>That’s all of the good news. The bad news is that it’s only rated IP54, meaning it’s not fully dustproof, and it’s only resistant to splashes rather than full immersion in water. Most other phones at this price offer a full IP68 rating, and a couple of cheaper midrange phones, like the Pixel 8A, still include IP67 water resistance. The Phone 2 also lacks official support for Verizon’s network, which rules it out for a lot of people in the US.</p>\n\n<p>There’s the Glyph Interface, too — those lights on the back of the phone. It’s a neat idea with some interesting applications if you invest a little time in tweaking it. You can flip it over to silence notifications when you need some time to focus and handpick certain “essential” alerts to light up the Glyph. Personally, I find it less helpful than a traditional focus mode or even the Phone 2’s always-on display. But others might find it useful, and if nothing else, it looks neat.</p>\n\n<p>The Phone 2 isn’t the best choice for sheer value — the Pixel 8A is a much better deal. It’s not the best choice for someone who just wants a phone to get them through their day with minimal hassle. But it’s undeniably different, and if you’re looking for something outside of the ordinary with a certain visual appeal, then it’s a worthy candidate.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"m9p9sv\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23792961/nothing-phone-2-review-glyph-screen-battery-camera\">Read my full Nothing Phone 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pudxmy\">Other phones we tested</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera\">Samsung Galaxy S25</a></strong> is a very good device, and it’s basically the last small-ish Android phone you can buy in the US.

Phones are boring now. And that’s just fine! Most people buying a new phone just want something familiar that works better than the device they’re replacing. If that’s your MO, then you’re sure to find something reliable in my recommendations below. \nBut even if you’re looking for something a little more extra, you’ve got some great options. They’re going to be pretty iterative compared to whatever you’re using now — we’re in more of a software era than a hardware innovation cycle these days — but you can find a delightful new device. We finally have a folding phone that feels like the right size and shape, flip phones offer a lot more than just nostalgia, and you can still buy a phone with no fewer than four cameras on the back. Not bad for a boring season of phone hardware.\nA lot of people in the US get their phones through carrier deals, and no judgment here if that’s the route you take — it’s how I bought mine. Just be sure you know what you’re getting into and how many years you’ll need to stay on that Super 5G Everything Unlimited Plus plan to keep the monthly device reimbursements coming.\n\n\nHow we test phones\nThere’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop-notch software support\nThe phones listed here have powerful processors and enough RAM to keep up for years, so it’s fair to expect more than a handful of OS updates throughout the life of your phone. Four years of new OS versions and five years of security updates is a healthy benchmark for this class, and many of the phones here meet or exceed that standard.\n\n\n\n\n\nA fantastic camera\nMost phone cameras can perform well in good lighting conditions, from the flagship class down to $300 budget phones. The devices listed here offer a little something extra, like a useful telephoto lens, a great portrait mode, or impressive low-light shooting — and many include all three. Stabilization for the main camera unit to help in low light is a must in this category.\n\n\n\n\n\nBest-in-class build quality\nThe very best devices come with robust IP68 ratings, durable glass on the front and back, and sturdy aluminum exterior frames.\n\n\n\n\n\nValue\nIn addition to the very best devices at any price, I look for phones that offer the best mix of must-have features for good prices. That might lead to a recommendation of a lower-tier model if it’s particularly feature-rich for its price or last year’s model if it’s still sold new and this year’s device doesn’t offer many upgrades.\n\n\nIf you’re looking to spend a little less and still get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500. For those recommendations, check out our guide to budget smartphones.\nThe best iPhone for most people\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 OLED, 60Hz refresh rate / Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nFrom a hardware perspective, the iPhone 16 (or the 16 Plus) is an easy upgrade choice. If you’re switching from an iPhone 13, 12, or even older, those four or five years of incremental performance improvements add up. But there’s something entirely new this time around — well, two things: the Action Button and the Camera Control button.\nThe customizable Action Button, which replaces the mute switch on the left edge of the phone, is a hand-me-down from the 15 Pro series. You can set it to open a particular app, turn on the flashlight, or almost anything else you might want at the touch of a button. On the other side of the phone is the Camera Control, which you can use to launch the camera app. With the camera open, it acts as a shutter button with a full press, and a light press brings up other exposure options you can adjust. Even if you only ever use it to launch the camera, it’s pretty handy, and it frees up the Action Button.\nThe iPhone 16 and its larger 16 Plus sibling use Apple’s A18 chipset, which is in the same family as the 16 Pro’s processor. That bodes well for the phones staying on the same software upgrade cycle. They both received Apple Intelligence in the fall, which included AI-powered writing tools and notification summaries in its earliest iteration, and eventually grew to support ChatGPT and a new Visual Intelligence feature. But despite the similarities, the regular 16 models lag behind the Pros in two important departments: the screen and the camera.\nThe Pros come with dedicated 5x lenses and updated main cameras that do a little better in low light. And you’ll only get a ProMotion display on the Pro models; the regular 16 features a slower 60Hz screen. Basically every other high-end phone on the market offers a 120Hz display, so that’s a disappointment. If those two drawbacks don’t bother you — and most people probably won’t mind them — then the iPhone 16 makes for a great upgrade.\nRead our full iPhone 16 review.\nThe best Android phone for most people\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 1080p 120Hz OLED / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 10.5-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 27W wired, 15W wireless (with Pixel Stand 2) / Weather resistance: IP68\nThe Android ecosystem has been looking for a phone like the Pixel 9 for a while now. It’s straightforward and unfussy, takes reliably good photos, and comes with the polished hardware you’d expect from a high-end phone. It doesn’t have a dedicated telephoto lens, which the similarly priced Galaxy S25 does, but the software is less quirky than Samsung’s, making for a better overall experience.\nOutside of zoom capabilities, Google’s Pixel camera is just as reliable as ever. The phone comes with a Tensor G4 chipset that powers AI features aplenty, both inside and outside of the camera app. Some are promising and some are worrying, but there’s nothing here that feels like a true game-changer. Which is fine.\nThe important thing is that the Pixel 9 has the right stuff where it counts. It’s easy to use, and some of the Pixel series’ persistent problems like poor thermals and buggy software seem to be under control in this generation. The 9 Pro is a worthwhile upgrade if you want that telephoto lens and a slightly nicer screen, but in any case, the Pixel 9 feels like a top-notch device, inside and out.\nRead our full Pixel 9 review.\nThe best high-end Android phone\nScreen: 6.9-inch, 1440p, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 200-megapixel main with OIS; 50-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless, Qi2 ready / Weather resistance: IP68\nSamsung’s “Ultra” S-series phone is still your best bet for a maximalist Android phone, even if ultra doesn’t quite mean what it once did. You still get four rear cameras — including a 3x and 5x telephoto — a massive screen, and a built-in S Pen stylus. The battery goes all day, the processor is top-notch, and there are AI features aplenty if you’re into that sort of thing. There’s just no other phone quite like it. \nThis year, Samsung removed the Bluetooth features from the stylus. That stings a little, especially considering that the company swapped a 10x zoom for the shorter 5x camera the year before. It still amounts to a great phone, but it’s one of the priciest slab-style phones you can buy and Samsung seems to be cutting features without adding back any extra value. It’s still “ultra” alright, but it doesn’t feel quite as special as it used to.\nRead my full Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nThe best phone for around $500\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G3 Cameras: 64-megapixel f/1.89 with OIS; 13-megapixel ultrawide; 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,492mAh / Charging: 18W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP67\nIt’s hard to beat the Pixel 8A on sheer ROI. For $500, you get a very good budget phone that comes with seven years of OS and security updates; most phones at this price will only see a handful of OS upgrades, if that. The 8A also comes with a good camera that covers the basics. It’s not as fancy as the Pixel 9 or 9 Pro, but it won’t prevent you from capturing that once-in-a-lifetime shot.\nThe Pixel 8A provides a lot of other things you wouldn’t necessarily expect from a $500 phone, like wireless charging and an IP67 rating for resistance against full water immersion. Of course, you can’t have everything. The 8A’s back panel is matte plastic rather than glass, sadly, and its 6.1-inch 1080p screen isn’t the best in its class.\nThere are other phones available for under $500 worth considering, many of which are covered in our guide to the best inexpensive phones. But if you’re looking for the absolute most value you can get from a $500 phone, then look no further than the 8A.\nRead my full review of the Google Pixel 8A.\nThe best high-end iPhone\nScreen: 6.3-inch, 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate / Processor: A18 Pro Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.8 with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie / Battery: Not advertised / Charging: 27W wired, 25W MagSafe wireless, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nLike all mainline iPhone 16 models, the 16 Pro gained the new Camera Control button, but it got another important update, too: a 5x telephoto lens. In the 15 series, that longer telephoto lens was reserved for the bigger Pro Max model. This time around, it’s on the smaller Pro, too, making it a great option for someone who wants to upgrade without upsizing their phone.\nLike the Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Pro uses an A18 Pro chipset designed to support Apple Intelligence, which started rolling out in the fall of 2024. The first update included things like notification summaries and the new glowing-border Siri UI, which Apple centered its launch event on. Subsequent updates brought ChatGPT integration and Visual Intelligence. But don’t expect anything radical — at least at first.\nOutside of AI, the 16 Pro is a fairly iterative update. The new Camera Control makes it easier to launch the camera and get right to taking photos, and it also frees up the Action Button if you were using it as a camera shortcut. The screen is a little bigger at 6.3 inches compared to 6.1 inches, even though the phone is basically the same size. You can record 4K video at 120fps now. And the new Photographic Styles, which are available on all iPhone 16 models, let you take more control over your photos than ever.\nThere’s nothing here that someone with an iPhone 15 Pro should upgrade for, but it’s an all-around solid device that will please Apple devotees, especially those who prefer a phone that isn’t too big.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro review.\nThe best flip phone\nScreen: 6.7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 3.4-inch, 720p, OLED cover screen / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 main with OIS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (inner screen) / Battery: 4,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP48\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 isn’t the most fun flip phone you can buy right now; that would be the 2024 Motorola Razr Plus. But fun only goes so far, and the Z Flip 6 is the more reliable of the two. When it comes to the device you use day in and day out, reliability counts for a lot.\nMotorola’s take on the modern flip phone embraces nostalgia with cute animations and a mode that sends the whole device back to the early 2000s. The Z Flip 6 lacks this kind of charm, but you do get an updated cover screen UI that’s more customizable than the Z Flip 5’s. The Flip 6 also comes with seven years of software updates, which matches the best software policies on the market. The hardware will probably give out long before the software, honestly.\nThat’s the other side of the flip phone coin: long-term durability is iffy. Sure, the Flip 6 is built to withstand full water immersion, but it still doesn’t have any formal dust resistance. For that reason, it isn’t a phone I would recommend to just anyone.\nThat said, the Z Flip 6’s outer screen does come in handy. You can do a lot with the prebaked widget options available to use, and if you’re just a little adventurous, you can run any app you want on the little screen. Starting a Strava workout or sending a quick text is a cinch, which is a big part of the appeal of a flip phone. Just, you know, keep this phone away from the beach.\nRead my full Galaxy Z Flip 6 review.\nThe best folding phone\nScreen: 8.0-inch, 2076p, 120Hz OLED inner screen; 6.3-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS; 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 10.5-megapixel ultrawide; 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen); 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,650mAh / Charging: 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather resistance: IPX8\nIt’s hard to convey just how nice the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is to use. It’s the first book-style folding phone that fully delivers on the promise of a foldable: it’s a tablet when you need it and a regular phone when you don’t.\nSamsung’s Z Fold series feels a little too narrow and cramped in its closed configuration, and the original Pixel Fold was too bulky and heavy to use comfortably. The 9 Pro Fold is lighter, and using its 6.3-inch outer screen feels basically like using a normal phone, which is a big win.\nThat’s really the theme of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold: it just feels normal. But there are a couple of decidedly not-normal things to consider: price and durability. The 9 Pro Fold costs $1,799 — basically the going rate for a book-style foldable but still a lot of money for a phone.\nAnd long-term durability is unclear, especially given that this is only Google’s second folding phone. It’s rated to withstand full water immersion, but as with any foldable, dust is a concern, so you’ll want to take a little extra care with this device. All that said, someone with the stomach (and wallet) for the 9 Pro Fold will find it a very rewarding device.\nRead my full Pixel 9 Pro Fold review.\nThe best phone for something completely different\nScreen: 6.7-inch, 1080p, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 / Cameras: 50-megapixel F/1.9 main with OIS; 50-megapixel ultrawide; 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,700mAh / Charging: 45W wired, 15W wireless / Weather resistance: IP54\nThe Nothing Phone 2 isn’t for everyone, but for the right kind of person, it’s a very good alternative to the Galaxies and Pixels of the world. It’s a style-driven device, from the dot-matrix-inspired UI to the flashing light strips on the back panel. Will its unique hardware and software features help you take back your attention span as Nothing claims? Eh, probably not. Mostly, it’s just a cool-looking gadget and a thoughtfully designed device.\nThe Phone 2 is equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 chipset, which is a slightly older but still very capable processor. Its 6.7-inch, 1080p screen supports a fast 120Hz top refresh rate, and its lowest 1Hz refresh rate allows it to offer an information-rich always-on display. The camera system is good, though not quite as consistent as the Pixel 7’s. There’s wireless charging, fast 45W wired charging, and an all-day battery.\nThat’s all of the good news. The bad news is that it’s only rated IP54, meaning it’s not fully dustproof, and it’s only resistant to splashes rather than full immersion in water. Most other phones at this price offer a full IP68 rating, and a couple of cheaper midrange phones, like the Pixel 8A, still include IP67 water resistance. The Phone 2 also lacks official support for Verizon’s network, which rules it out for a lot of people in the US.\nThere’s the Glyph Interface, too — those lights on the back of the phone. It’s a neat idea with some interesting applications if you invest a little time in tweaking it. You can flip it over to silence notifications when you need some time to focus and handpick certain “essential” alerts to light up the Glyph. Personally, I find it less helpful than a traditional focus mode or even the Phone 2’s always-on display. But others might find it useful, and if nothing else, it looks neat.\nThe Phone 2 isn’t the best choice for sheer value — the Pixel 8A is a much better deal. It’s not the best choice for someone who just wants a phone to get them through their day with minimal hassle. But it’s undeniably different, and if you’re looking for something outside of the ordinary with a certain visual appeal, then it’s a worthy candidate.\nRead my full Nothing Phone 2 review.\nOther phones we tested\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 is a very good device, and it’s basically the last small-ish Android phone you can buy in the US. I find the software to be fussier and more cluttered than the Pixel 9’s, so it’s not my overall pick, but it’s a reliable device — and your best bet for a phone that isn’t gigantic.\nThe 2024 Motorola Razr Plus is a delightful flip phone with tons of nostalgic vibes, with a big cover screen that’s handy for accessing quick tasks without opening the phone. But Motorola’s track record for timely software updates isn’t great, making it hard to fully endorse the Razr Plus. \nThe iPhone 16E is a great phone that makes a lot of interesting trade-offs. Apple’s latest entry-level phone starts at $599 and comes with the company’s latest A18 processor, USB-C and wireless charging, a 60Hz OLED display, and the customizable Action Button found on Apple’s more premium handsets. The 6.1-inch phone doesn’t have MagSafe support or a Camera Control button, though, and it’s limited to a single 48-megapixel Fusion camera (sorry, ultrawide stans). That makes it hard for us to recommend over the standard iPhone 16, even if it does start at $200 less.\nWhat’s coming next\nSamsung is preparing to launch two new budget phones, the $399 A36 and the $299 A26, both of which will support Google’s Circle to Search feature and some of the AI-powered editing tools already available on Samsung’s S25 series phones. Both have a 6.7-inch full HD Plus display with an up to 120Hz refresh rate, a 5,000mAh battery, and ship with Android 15; however, the A36 offers a speedier Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 chip and 45W wireless charging, not to mention a “larger vapor chamber” for better performance.\nThe budget follow-up to the Pixel 8A, the Pixel 9A, will reportedly arrive on March 26th and start at $499 for 128GB of storage. The latest rumors indicate it will sport a 6.3-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 8GB of RAM, a 5,100mAh battery, and Google’s Tensor G4 chip. It may also ditch the camera bump if leaked renders are to be believed, allowing it to lie flat when placed on a table.\nUpdate, March 3rd: Adjusted pricing/availability and added a mention of several new phones, including the Google Pixel 9A and Samsung’s Galaxy A36.

| Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge\n\nGadgets, much like fashion, can make style comebacks. For tech: we’ve lived through the ’80s beige keyboards, transitioned to the ’90s with gray and black plastic video game systems plus bright colors for Sony’s Walkman and Nintendo’s Game Boy handhelds, and then, at the turn of the millennium, welcomed the amazing see-through iMacs, N64 controllers, and other gadgets with clear casings.\nAnd just like the return of grunge makeup and baggy jeans, transparent tech is back. See-through devices are leapfrogging over the ’00s piano white iPods, ’10s matte black smartphones, and some of today’s colored aluminum and glass finishes to (hopefully) become the next big trend. Now, we’ve got clear smartphones like the Nothing Phone, see-through earbuds like the Beats Studio buds, colorful translucent shell casings for game consoles, and even chargers and USB-C cables that show off some capacitors for your pleasure.\nSo dust off your Apple Studio Display CRT monitor, Toys R Us-exclusive Extreme Green colored N64 controller, and your other favorite transparent gadgets as

Modern trackers can monitor everything from your heart health to how well you’ve recovered from a hard bout of training. Even flagship smartwatches, which used to be lackluster trackers, have become pretty adept workout companions. Whatever your fitness goals are, there’s probably a fitness tracker that can help you achieve them.</p>\n\n<p>Compared to some other gadgets, wearables are incredibly personal, which means there are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22940671/fitness-tracker-how-to-choose-specs-price-features-smartwatch\">a few extra considerations</a> you’ll have to take into account before reaching for your wallet. It makes it hard to say that any one fitness tracker is the best for everyone. Thankfully, the best thing about fitness trackers in 2025 is that there’s enough variety to fit into every kind of lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Audience</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Who is this fitness tracker for?

Smartwatches are definitely getting more high-tech, but the Active 2 keeps the spirit of a humble fitness tracker — a good price, all the basic health features with a holistic tracking approach, and a comfy yet stylish design. At $99.99 for the standard version, and $129.99 for the premium version, you get an incredible amount of bang for your buck. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The hardware and design are surprisingly chic for the price. The standard version has a stainless steel case and tempered glass screen, while the premium version bumps you up to sapphire crystal and gets you an extra leather strap. The screen itself is nice and bright at 2,000 nits and you get an estimated 10 days of regular use on a single charge. (In testing, I got closer to eight to nine days as a power-user.) European users also get NFC payments. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257523_Amazfit_Active_2_AKrales_0080.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;I almost never get compliments on budget trackers.

It’s also got a daily readiness score and detailed sleep tracking if you’re into recovery metrics. (There’s also a Zepp Aura AI chatbot if you ever want to get more in-depth insights into your recovery metrics; It costs an extra $77 yearly but it’s also totally optional.) For workouts, it supports 160 different sport types, including HYROX and a new strength training mode that automatically counts reps. The Active 2 also adds offline maps, turn-by-turn directions, the ability to connect to third-party peripherals, and Zepp Coach — an AI-powered coach that can generate custom training plans for you. Built-in GPS with five satellite systems is also included.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t have a lot to complain about. My biggest gripes are the touch screen is hard to use with sweaty fingers and the onboard AI assistant for voice commands sometimes requires you to enunciate. You do lack advanced health features, like EKGs or sleep apnea detection, but that’s not really the point of something like the Active 2. This is meant to be a classic, basic fitness tracker that happens to look like a watch — and it does that with aplomb. </p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"iQzNNC\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/smartwatch-review/608342/amazfit-active-2-review-budget-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracker\">Read my full review of the Amazfit Active 2 here</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oekq80\">Best fitness watch for casual users</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;40mm w/ 20mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;38g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 11 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;All-systems GNSS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Ant Plus /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;4GB (for Music Edition)</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $250 Garmin Venu Sq 2 is the watch I recommend for anyone looking to replace their aging <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855458/fitbit-versa-2-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-price-specs-features\">Fitbit Versa 2</a>, 3,<strong> </strong>or 4. It’s got a similar look and vibe, with a much nicer OLED display and longer battery life.</p>\n\n<p>Garmin is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking, and that’s not an exception here. Of course, you get the basics, like steps and calories burned, but you get a whole lot more, too. There’s built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as plenty of other sports profiles like yoga and strength training. For smart features, you get push notifications, timers, contactless payments, and a bunch of safety features like Garmin’s Incident Detection, which is its take on fall detection. (You will need to carry your phone with you, however, as this doesn’t have LTE.)</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24259063/226428_Garmin_Venu_Sq_2_AKrales_0049.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Garmin Venu Sq 2 showing bright clock face on woman’s wrist\" title=\"Garmin Venu Sq 2 showing bright clock face on woman’s wrist\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Garmin Venu Sq 2 has a bright, beautiful OLED display and long battery life.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>If you want the option of onboard music, you can shell out $50 extra for the Music Edition, which comes with enough storage for about 500 songs. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, as you’ll most likely have your phone on you since this isn’t a true standalone watch.</p>\n\n<p>What I like most about this watch, however, is it’s one that you can grow with. On top of recovery metrics and sleep tracking, it also has Garmin Coach — a built-in, <em>free</em> training program for beginner and intermediate-level runners hoping to tackle a 5K, 10K, or half marathon. For health tracking, you can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, intensity minutes (how many minutes of moderate exercise you get per week), stress, hydration, respiratory rate, and menstrual cycles. And the best part is Garmin doesn’t lock any of this behind a paywall.</p>\n\n<p>One note: there is a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23982519/garmin-venu-3s-review-smartwatch-sleep-tracking-wearable\">Venu 3</a>, which adds a newer heart rate sensor and nap detection. I liked it quite a bit, and it ticks off a lot of the right boxes — except for price. It’s $450, which puts it outside what I’d consider ideal for casual users. The other option is Garmin’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24107020/garmin-forerunner-165-music-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Forerunner 165</a> — it’s a $249 budget training watch that’s quite similar to the Venu Sq 2 feature-wise, albeit with a sportier vibe. Basically, go with what you find on sale. I firmly believe older models are still a good choice if all you want is the fitness-tracking basics. This is especially true since newer software updates often make their way to older Garmins. Garmin users also tend to hang onto their devices for a good while. Strava’s 2023 year-end survey found that the most popular smartwatch among its users <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/3/24024332/strava-users-are-still-hangin-onto-their-old-garmins\">was an eight-year-old Garmin</a>!</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1cZJF6\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23500640/garmin-venu-sq-2-review-smartwatch-fitness-tracker\">Read my full review of the Garmin Venu Sq 2</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"GnB1mV\">Best for serious outdoor athletes</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;7S Pro: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 7: 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 7X: 51mm w/ 26mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;7S Pro: 63g (Solar), 58g or 65g (Sapphire Solar, titanium or stainless steel); 7: 79g (Solar), 73g (Sapphire Solar); 7X: 96g (Solar), 89g (Sapphire Solar) /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong> 7S: up to 11 days, 14 w/ Solar; 7: up to 18 days, 22 days w/ solar; 7X: up to 28 days, 37 w/ solar /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;MIP touchscreen /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;10ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Garmin’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22937154/garmin-fenix-7s-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch\">flagship Fenix 7 series</a> is no joke, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup takes it up a notch. It’s got built-in multiband GPS, solar charging on all models, the option of touchscreen or button navigation, topographical maps, and oodles upon oodles of data. Plus, every Fenix 7 Pro model has a hands-free LED flashlight, an upgraded heart rate sensor, and an improved memory-in-pixel display that’s slightly easier to read in low lighting.</p>\n\n<p>Garmin wearables are also known for providing extensive in-depth metrics, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup<strong> </strong>is no exception. You get excellent recovery metrics as well as helpful training guides and coaching programs. The best part is that Garmin doesn’t charge extra for those features. That’s good news, as these are expensive watches.</p>\n\n<p>I appreciate how quickly these Fenix 7 watches can pick up a GPS signal. That’s a must if you’re training in the dead of winter. These watches can also take a beating. All models are built to military-grade standards and feature up to 10ATM of water resistance. That means they’re more than capable of a dunk in the ocean.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24806204/236729_Garmin_Fenix_7S_Pro_AKrales_0175.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A straight-on look at the Fenix 7S Pro’s flashlight at maximum brightness\" title=\"A straight-on look at the Fenix 7S Pro’s flashlight at maximum brightness\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The hands-free flashlight rules!&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Although the screen is brighter, <a href=\"https://os.mbed.com/teams/JapanDisplayInc/wiki/MIP-reflective-color-display\">MIP displays</a> still aren’t my absolute favorite — the OLED on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22934516/garmin-epix-2-review\">Garmin Epix 2</a> and the Epix Pro<strong> </strong>are much easier on the eyes. It’s admittedly tough to pick between the Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, Epix 2, and Epix Pro lineups — especially now that the Epix Pro also has great battery life, the LED flashlight, and now comes in multiple sizes. What it boils down to is whether you prioritize a brighter display, longer battery life, or price.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I prefer the Epix Pro for better readability, but the Fenix 7 Pro is the better choice if this is your first introduction to Garmin’s platform. You’ll get better battery life, the same LED flashlight, all the same training features, and a lower starting price.

That said, I still think the standard Fenix 7 or 7 Pro lineup is the better overall value. The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24266434/garmin-fenix-8-review-smartwatch-wearables-fitness-tracking\">Fenix 8</a> adds diving features and voice assistant capabilities, but it also ups the standard Fenix 7’s starting price of $650 by an additional $350.

The smart ring is a good option for people who are looking for something a little more discreet. It’s also less distracting than some other wrist-based options, as it lacks a screen and doesn’t mirror push notifications from your phone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The new Oura Ring 4 isn’t functionally that much different from the previous Gen 3. It’s slimmer, features a new all-titanium design, has improved battery life, and has a new sensor algorithm that Oura says is more accurate. None of the new software features are gatekept to the Ring 4, so Gen 3 owners shouldn’t feel the need to upgrade unless their ring no longer lasts more than two days on a single charge. That said, the fourth-gen ring has an expanded size range spanning from 4 to 15. If you felt your Gen 3 was a bit snug or couldn’t find a size that fit right, you may have a better option now.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25665134/247314_Oura_Ring_4_AKrales_0022.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close up of Oura Ring 4 \" title=\"Close up of Oura Ring 4 \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Oura Ring 4 has an expanded size range, spanning sizes 4 to 15.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>While smaller than your average wearable, the Oura Ring still tracks a ton of metrics, including heart rate variability, body temperature, blood oxygen, all-day heart rate monitoring, and cycle tracking. Since launching, the Oura Ring has also added activity tracking, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/26/23278819/oura-ring-gen-3-spo2-blood-oxygen\">blood oxygen levels</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640205/oura-ring-sleep-tracking-chronotype-circadian-rhythm\">chronotypes</a> to help visualize your circadian rhythms, a social feature called <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23752876/oura-ring-social-circles-sleep-stage-algorithm\">Circles</a>, improved stress tracking, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/10/24152827/oura-ring-cardiovascular-age-vo2-max-wearables\">cardiovascular age and capacity metrics</a>, and even an AI chatbot (in beta). It’s also rolled out a new <a href=\"https://ouraring.com/blog/developing-ouras-latest-sleep-staging-algorithm/\">sleep stages algorithm</a> that it claims is more accurate than before. The app has also been entirely revamped to better organize all these new features and metrics.</p>\n\n<p>The Oura Ring tracks typical metrics — such as steps and calories burned —&nbsp; but its main focus is sleep and recovery. Each day, you’re given three sets of scores for your readiness, sleep, and activity. It’s a simple, holistic look at your overall wellness and an ideal pick if you want a more hands-off experience with your data.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Watch, you may want to consider the $399.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables\">Galaxy Ring</a>. It’s a bit more expensive than the base Oura Ring, but it doesn’t come with a subscription, and you get much better battery life when used with the Galaxy Watch. The hardware is also excellent, especially the charging case. That said, this is only an option for Android users, and even then, you don’t unlock its full potential unless you’ve got other Samsung gear. I also recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/ULTRAHUMAN-AIR-Smart-Health-Tracker-Fitness/dp/B0D983R3N3\">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> for folks who don’t like the idea of Oura’s monthly subscription.</p>\n\n<p>You can read my experiences with <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259284/oura-ring-samsung-galaxy-ring-ultrahuman-ring-air-ringconn-circular-ring-evie-ring-review-wearables\">a bunch of other smart rings</a>, but right now, the Oura Ring is the most polished with the best overall experience.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vRevUH\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">Read my full review of the Oura Ring 4</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"uc1OzU\">Best fitness band</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Size:</strong>&nbsp;42mm x 24mm x 12.2mm with 16mm straps /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;28g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 18 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Tethered /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;None</em></em></p>\n\n<p>It’s truly hard to beat the Amazfit Band 7’s $49.99 price — doubly so since you can often find it on sale for even less. Wearing the Band 7 feels like a throwback to 2014, which is great if all you’re looking for is a simple and casual tracker that won’t break the bank.</p>\n\n<p>No one is going to compliment you on the Band 7’s design, but it’s got a handful of cute watch faces that make good use of its OLED touchscreen. And despite having an OLED display, you’ll still get roughly 14 days of battery life on a single charge. It’s also incredibly lightweight, making it a good option for sleep tracking as well.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24477148/236555_Amazfit_Band_7_AKrales_0088.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Amazfit Band 7 with colorful clock face worn on woman’s wrist.\" title=\"Amazfit Band 7 with colorful clock face worn on woman’s wrist.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Amazfit Band 7 won’t turn heads, but it’s the type of capable yet affordable fitness band that’s much harder to find nowadays.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>You also get an absurd number of features for the price. That includes Amazon Alexa, continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, stress tracking, advanced sleep tracking, training metrics like VO2 max and load, abnormal heart rate alerts, menstrual tracking, push notifications, find my phone, a camera remote, and even a Pomodoro timer. You’re sacrificing contactless payments and will have to settle for tethered GPS, but this is a fair tradeoff considering everything else you’re getting. It’s not the best option for hardcore fitness tracking, but this is a great option if all you’re looking to do is casually track activity and your steps.</p>\n\n<p>Amazfit’s been making surprisingly good budget trackers for a while. That said, if you’re a little wary of a lesser-known brand, the $159.95 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23958997/fitbit-charge-6-review-fitness-tracker-side-button\">Fitbit Charge 6</a> is a decent alternative. It’s pricier, but you get a lot of what Amazfit is missing. That includes Google services like YouTube Music, Google Wallet, and Google Maps. Plus, it has built-in GPS and the ability to broadcast your heart rate with some Bluetooth-compatible gym equipment.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"WDJw0V\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23652417/amazfit-band-7-review-budget-fitness-tracker\">Read my full review of the Amazfit Band 7</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"QxUXWf\">Most stylish fitness watch</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;37mm with 18mm straps  /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;45g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 39 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp; OLED display /&nbsp;<strong>GPS:</strong>&nbsp;Tethered GPS /&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;N/A</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light is a fetching hybrid analog smartwatch. Think of it as a dressier fitness band with some Swatch-like design sensibilities. It’s got all your basics like simple push notifications, timers, and alarms. Plus, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS activities straight from the wrist. It looks spiffy on the wrist, and if you like a pop of color, Withings offers minty green and pale blue color options. It’s also got excellent battery life, with an estimated 30 days on a single charge. I got a little less in testing at around 25 days, but that’s still much better than the vast majority of flagship smartwatches. This also looks way more stylish than beefier multisport watches with similar battery life.</p>\n\n<p>As its name suggests, the Light is a pared-down version of the $349.95 ScanWatch 2. The main things you’re missing are an EKG sensor for atrial fibrillation detection, a temperature sensor, blood oxygen tracking, and an altimeter for tracking elevation. For basic fitness tracking, you don’t really need those sensors. That’s why I think the extra $100 in savings is worth it for the Light, especially since both are lacking in safety features, contactless payments, and some other bells and whistles you can get from other watches in the $350 price range. That said, if you want extras, the ScanWatch 2 also gets you a slightly more elegant look thanks to the second step-counter dial.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25282433/247014_Withings_ScanWatch_2_Light_AKrales_0059.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close up of Withings ScanWatch 2\" title=\"Close up of Withings ScanWatch 2\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The ScanWatch 2 is about $100 more but adds more advanced health tracking.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Another option I like is the $179.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22882401/garmin-vivomove-sport-review-fitness-tracker-smartwatch-wearables\">Garmin Vivomove Sport</a>, which actually dominated this category in the past few years. It’s hard to beat the price, especially since it gets you access to Garmin’s platform. However, Garmin’s “hidden” OLED display can get washed out in bright lighting, and battery life was significantly shorter than other hybrid analog watches at around five days. Still, if you’d prefer a platform with a focus on fitness rather than wellness, the Vivomove Sport may be the better move over a Withings watch.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dB7TrL\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24085043/withings-scanwatch-2-scanwatch-light-review-wearables-smartwatch\">Read my full review of the Withings ScanWatch 2 and Light</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xIBcrh\">Best fitness tracker for iPhone users</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;42mm, 46mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;29.3g (42mm), 35.3g (46mm) /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 18 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type:</strong>&nbsp;Always-on LTPO OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS: </strong>Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 50 meters /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a smartwatch that does fitness well, then iPhone owners need to look no further than the $399 Apple Watch Series 10. (The LTE version costs $50 more.) This is another iterative update, but the Series 10 is a much more comfortable watch than previous models. It’s thinner and lighter, plus there’s a larger display. If you’ve got a Series 5 or older, now is a good time to upgrade.</p>\n\n<p>With watchOS 11, there’s a new suite of training features. There’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/15/24195983/watchos-11-preview-training-load-vitals-fitness\">Training Load</a>, which gives you greater insight into how intensely you’ve been working out the past week compared to the last 28 days. There’s also a new Vitals app that flags when key metrics, like sleep duration or heart rate, may be out of whack. Plus, you can <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24175506/apple-watch-watchos-11-rest-days-wearables\">finally pause your rings</a> for rest days. The software update also brings some savvy updates to the Smart Stack. For example, if you’re in a noisy cafe wondering what song’s playing, the Smart Stack can now surface the Shazaam widget. It also now supports Live Activities, turning your wrist into a mini Dynamic Island. Health-wise, we also now have FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, we also have to address <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24009254/apple-watch-itc-ban-patent-dispute\">the Apple Watch ban</a>. As of January 18th, 2024, new Apple Watches sold in the US have the blood oxygen feature disabled due to an ongoing patent battle with medical device maker Masimo. This isn’t a huge deal for most people, as this feature isn’t that useful for most people yet, and the new sleep apnea feature exclusively uses the accelerometer rather than the blood oxygen sensor. You might want to consider a refurbished Series 7 or 8 if blood oxygen sensing is important to you, however.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a first-time buyer, you can also opt for the second-gen <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">Apple Watch SE</a>. It’s slightly cheaper at $249, and while you don’t get as many features, it’s a good introduction to the ecosystem. Otherwise, if you’re the type of athlete who covets a Garmin, you may also want to consider splurging on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. It’s more expensive at $799, but it does have the brightest screen of any Apple Watch, comes with dual-frequency GPS, has diving and hiking safety features, and is made of more durable materials. There’s also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248380/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-smartwatch-wearables\">a fetching new black color</a>.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ic9D8k\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full review of the Apple Watch Series 10</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"AsVbve\">Best fitness smartwatch for Samsung phones</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;47mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;60.5g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 100 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type: </strong>Always-on OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS: </strong>Built-in GPS&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;10ATM, IP68 /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Truthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra left me a bit disappointed after reviewing it — not because it’s a bad piece of hardware, but because it copies a bit too much from Apple. Even so, this is the most full-featured fitness smartwatch a Samsung phone owner can buy.</p>\n\n<p>While I prefer the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch 7 </a>myself, I can’t say it’s the best for fitness tracking. There was too much of a gap between it and the Ultra in my testing as far as accuracy, especially for GPS tracking. But what really sealed the deal for me was the difference in battery life. It’s simply night and day, and the Galaxy Watch 7 really struggled in this arena. (The gaps are much less egregious between the base Apple Watch and Ultra 2.)</p>\n\n<p>The caveat is, if all you want is casual fitness tracking, the Galaxy Watch 7 is the better choice for wearability. It’s just more comfortable for sleep tracking and lighter overall. Just keep in mind it lacks the Ultra’s emergency siren and shortcut button, and the screen doesn’t get quite as bright.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25554228/gwultra_2.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Close-up of Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on shoes\" title=\"Close-up of Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra on shoes\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It’s not the prettiest Samsung watch, but it is the best at fitness tracking.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\" />\n<p>With both watches, you get a faster processor, a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, some AI health features, and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The newer hardware makes for a more futureproof purchase, but I found the AI health features to be hit-or-miss in practice. As always, some features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, are limited to Samsung owners. That makes this hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to non-Samsung Android users.</p>\n\n<p>But if the Ultra doesn’t float your boat, now is a good time to find the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23818557/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review-bezels-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch 6 series</a>, particularly the base models, on sale. The base Galaxy Watch 7 may have newer hardware, but as far as actual use goes, it’s not a massive update over the Watch 6. And if you’re into a physical rotating bezel, just go ahead and snag a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"AbaYyl\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read my full review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"J4WTr1\">Best fitness smartwatch for Android</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong>&nbsp;41mm, 45mm /&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;31g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 24 hours /&nbsp;<strong>Display type: </strong>Always-on OLED /&nbsp;<strong>GPS: </strong>Built-in GPS&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;5ATM /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;32GB</em></em></p>\n\n<p>With the Pixel Watch 3, Google is finally done playing catch-up.</p>\n\n<p>There are truly too many updates to call each one out individually, but overall, they fall into two buckets: refinement and expansion. The hardware is mostly the same as the Pixel Watch 2 in terms of design. However, we now have a brighter screen, smaller bezels, and a new 45mm size. The larger size is quite nice, especially if you prefer larger screens without sacrificing wearability.</p>\n\n<p>Battery life is also better. There’s a new battery-saver mode that kicks in when you hit 15 percent, and the new displays are also more power efficient. Plus, bedtime mode is automatic now, so that helps the watch last longer overnight for sleep tracking. It’s only a modest improvement over the Pixel Watch 2, but it’s dramatic compared to the original.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25610300/247234_Pixel_Watch_3_AKrales_0303.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Person tying shoes while wearing both sizes of the Pixel Watch 3\" title=\"Person tying shoes while wearing both sizes of the Pixel Watch 3\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Watch now comes in two sizes: 41mm (right) and 45mm (left).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Software is where the Pixel Watch 3 makes the most updates. There are a ton of new fitness and health features, including a new running dashboard, custom running workouts, and AI-generated workout suggestions. There’s also a revamped Daily Readiness Score and a new Cardio Load metric, which gauges how intensely you’ve been exercising. For European users, you can also get the new Loss of Pulse feature, which calls emergency services on your behalf if it detects you no longer have a pulse. Unfortunately, this isn’t available stateside, as it hasn’t yet received FDA clearance.</p>\n\n<p>The Pixel Watch 3 also better integrates with Google services and the Pixel ecosystem. You can now view your Nest Doorbell or Camera feed straight from the wrist — and it’s quite handy if you get a lot of packages or guests. If you have Google TV, you can use the watch as a remote. Now that the watch has an ultra wideband chip, it can also now unlock your Pixel phone. You can also use the Recorder app to capture audio and send it straight to your Pixel phone.</p>\n\n<p>That said, some of these features now mean the Pixel Watch works best with a Pixel phone. If you’re looking for alternatives to Google and Samsung, the $299.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24132998/one-plus-watch-2-review-smartwatches-wearables\">OnePlus Watch 2</a> is a strong alternative. You’re giving up LTE, but it’s a handsome-looking watch with surprisingly long battery life and Google Assistant from the get-go.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"50Vbxm\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Read my full review of the Google Pixel Watch 3</a>.</h4>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4r15d2\">Best for early adopters and elite athletes</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Sizes:</strong> 43mm by 28mm by 10mm<strong> </strong>/&nbsp;<strong>Weight:</strong>&nbsp;18g /&nbsp;<strong>Battery life:</strong>&nbsp;4–5 days /&nbsp;<strong>Display type: </strong>None /&nbsp;<strong>GPS: </strong>None&nbsp;/&nbsp;<strong>Connectivity:</strong>&nbsp;Bluetooth /&nbsp;<strong>Water resistance:</strong>&nbsp;Up to 10 meters /&nbsp;<strong>Music storage:</strong>&nbsp;None</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22957195/whoop-review-fitness-tracker-wearables\">Whoop 4.0</a> is not for the casual enthusiast. Not only does it come with an expensive monthly subscription, but the information it provides is only useful if you’re actively training for a cardio-intensive sport. If strength training is your main form of exercise, you’re better off looking elsewhere. Like the Oura Ring, this is a distraction-free tracker that specializes in sleep and recovery. The main difference is this has a more athletic bent. For instance, you’ll get way more insight into how much strain you’ve taken on in the past week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Whoop also provides <a href=\"https://shop.whoop.com/en-us/collections/whoopbody/?order_by=featured\">a lot of novel ways to wear its tracker</a>, including in underwear and arm/knee sleeves. This makes it an appealing option if you’re one of those unicorns who needs a <em>secondary</em> tracker to supplement another form of fitness tracking. Again, this is a tracker best appreciated by people who go hard and aren’t afraid to experiment.&nbsp;Plus, Whoop recently <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/16/23602633/whoop-subscription-wearable-fitness-tracker-pricing-inflation\">lowered its subscription prices</a> in certain tiers, so while it’s still expensive, it’s not <em>quite</em> as pricey as it used to be.</p>\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ZuYiCM\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22957195/whoop-review-fitness-tracker-wearables\">Read my full review of the Whoop 4.0</a>.</h4>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23277338/vsong_220225_5048_0008.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,17.789497998152,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"The Whoop 4.0 in a strap, the battery pack, and the sports bra.\" title=\"The Whoop 4.0 in a strap, the battery pack, and the sports bra.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Whoop 4.0 is best for elite athletes or people who don’t mind experimental trackers.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge\" />\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"how-we-test-fitness-trackers\">How we test fitness trackers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fitness trackers are meant to help you keep track of your health and activity. We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy. Some factors we consider in our rankings are durability, performance, accuracy versus consistency in metrics, and of course, battery life. </p>\n</div>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, March</strong> 3: Updated pricing and availability.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Fitness trackers have come a long way from the simple bands that tracked steps and little else. Modern trackers can monitor everything from your heart health to how well you’ve recovered from a hard bout of training. Even flagship smartwatches, which used to be lackluster trackers, have become pretty adept workout companions. Whatever your fitness goals are, there’s probably a fitness tracker that can help you achieve them.\nCompared to some other gadgets, wearables are incredibly personal, which means there are a few extra considerations you’ll have to take into account before reaching for your wallet. It makes it hard to say that any one fitness tracker is the best for everyone. Thankfully, the best thing about fitness trackers in 2025 is that there’s enough variety to fit into every kind of lifestyle. \n\n\nAudience\nWho is this fitness tracker for? The ideal fitness tracker for hardcore athletes will look different than the best one for casual users looking to get a few more steps in.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life\nA fitness tracker should be able to go at least two to three days between charges. If it’s a flagship smartwatch, it should at least offer quick charging.\n\n\n\n\n\nForm factor\nIs it a band or a smartwatch? Is it comfortable to wear 24/7?\n\n\n\n\n\nMetrics\nWhat metrics does this device track? We prioritize active minutes over steps and calorie burn, but health metrics like resting heart rate, VO2 Max, and sleep quality are plusses.\n\n\n\n\n\nConsistency\nAccuracy is nice, but it’s more important for measuring progress that your device delivers consistent results for heart rate, distance tracking, and steps.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlatform\nCertain trackers are limited to specific phone ecosystems — others will work regardless of what your phone is. We prioritize the latter wherever possible.\n\n\nBest fitness tracker overall\nSize: 43mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 29.5g for standard, 31.7g for premium / Battery life: Up to 10 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: Five GNSS systems / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nHear us out: the Amazfit Active 2 is the new all-rounder on the block. Smartwatches are definitely getting more high-tech, but the Active 2 keeps the spirit of a humble fitness tracker — a good price, all the basic health features with a holistic tracking approach, and a comfy yet stylish design. At $99.99 for the standard version, and $129.99 for the premium version, you get an incredible amount of bang for your buck. \nThe hardware and design are surprisingly chic for the price. The standard version has a stainless steel case and tempered glass screen, while the premium version bumps you up to sapphire crystal and gets you an extra leather strap. The screen itself is nice and bright at 2,000 nits and you get an estimated 10 days of regular use on a single charge. (In testing, I got closer to eight to nine days as a power-user.) European users also get NFC payments. \nAs far as health features go, you get all the basics like continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen rate, heart rate variability, stress tracking, alerts for abnormally high and low heart rate, and skin temperature tracking. It’s also got a daily readiness score and detailed sleep tracking if you’re into recovery metrics. (There’s also a Zepp Aura AI chatbot if you ever want to get more in-depth insights into your recovery metrics; It costs an extra $77 yearly but it’s also totally optional.) For workouts, it supports 160 different sport types, including HYROX and a new strength training mode that automatically counts reps. The Active 2 also adds offline maps, turn-by-turn directions, the ability to connect to third-party peripherals, and Zepp Coach — an AI-powered coach that can generate custom training plans for you. Built-in GPS with five satellite systems is also included.\nI don’t have a lot to complain about. My biggest gripes are the touch screen is hard to use with sweaty fingers and the onboard AI assistant for voice commands sometimes requires you to enunciate. You do lack advanced health features, like EKGs or sleep apnea detection, but that’s not really the point of something like the Active 2. This is meant to be a classic, basic fitness tracker that happens to look like a watch — and it does that with aplomb. \nRead my full review of the Amazfit Active 2 here.\nBest fitness watch for casual users\nSizes: 40mm w/ 20mm straps / Weight: 38g / Battery life: Up to 11 days / Display type: OLED touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 4GB (for Music Edition)\nThe $250 Garmin Venu Sq 2 is the watch I recommend for anyone looking to replace their aging Fitbit Versa 2, 3, or 4. It’s got a similar look and vibe, with a much nicer OLED display and longer battery life.\nGarmin is known for its comprehensive fitness tracking, and that’s not an exception here. Of course, you get the basics, like steps and calories burned, but you get a whole lot more, too. There’s built-in GPS for tracking walks, runs, and bike rides, as well as plenty of other sports profiles like yoga and strength training. For smart features, you get push notifications, timers, contactless payments, and a bunch of safety features like Garmin’s Incident Detection, which is its take on fall detection. (You will need to carry your phone with you, however, as this doesn’t have LTE.)\nIf you want the option of onboard music, you can shell out $50 extra for the Music Edition, which comes with enough storage for about 500 songs. I wouldn’t recommend it, however, as you’ll most likely have your phone on you since this isn’t a true standalone watch.\nWhat I like most about this watch, however, is it’s one that you can grow with. On top of recovery metrics and sleep tracking, it also has Garmin Coach — a built-in, free training program for beginner and intermediate-level runners hoping to tackle a 5K, 10K, or half marathon. For health tracking, you can monitor heart rate, blood oxygen, intensity minutes (how many minutes of moderate exercise you get per week), stress, hydration, respiratory rate, and menstrual cycles. And the best part is Garmin doesn’t lock any of this behind a paywall.\nOne note: there is a Venu 3, which adds a newer heart rate sensor and nap detection. I liked it quite a bit, and it ticks off a lot of the right boxes — except for price. It’s $450, which puts it outside what I’d consider ideal for casual users. The other option is Garmin’s Forerunner 165 — it’s a $249 budget training watch that’s quite similar to the Venu Sq 2 feature-wise, albeit with a sportier vibe. Basically, go with what you find on sale. I firmly believe older models are still a good choice if all you want is the fitness-tracking basics. This is especially true since newer software updates often make their way to older Garmins. Garmin users also tend to hang onto their devices for a good while. Strava’s 2023 year-end survey found that the most popular smartwatch among its users was an eight-year-old Garmin!\nRead my full review of the Garmin Venu Sq 2.\nBest for serious outdoor athletes\nSizes: 7S Pro: 42mm w/ 20mm straps; 7: 47mm w/ 22mm straps; 7X: 51mm w/ 26mm straps / Weight: 7S Pro: 63g (Solar), 58g or 65g (Sapphire Solar, titanium or stainless steel); 7: 79g (Solar), 73g (Sapphire Solar); 7X: 96g (Solar), 89g (Sapphire Solar) / Battery life: 7S: up to 11 days, 14 w/ Solar; 7: up to 18 days, 22 days w/ solar; 7X: up to 28 days, 37 w/ solar / Display type: MIP touchscreen / GPS: All-systems GNSS and dual-frequency GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth, Ant Plus, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM / Music storage: Up to 32GB\nGarmin’s flagship Fenix 7 series is no joke, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup takes it up a notch. It’s got built-in multiband GPS, solar charging on all models, the option of touchscreen or button navigation, topographical maps, and oodles upon oodles of data. Plus, every Fenix 7 Pro model has a hands-free LED flashlight, an upgraded heart rate sensor, and an improved memory-in-pixel display that’s slightly easier to read in low lighting.\nGarmin wearables are also known for providing extensive in-depth metrics, and the Fenix 7 Pro lineup is no exception. You get excellent recovery metrics as well as helpful training guides and coaching programs. The best part is that Garmin doesn’t charge extra for those features. That’s good news, as these are expensive watches.\nI appreciate how quickly these Fenix 7 watches can pick up a GPS signal. That’s a must if you’re training in the dead of winter. These watches can also take a beating. All models are built to military-grade standards and feature up to 10ATM of water resistance. That means they’re more than capable of a dunk in the ocean.\nAlthough the screen is brighter, MIP displays still aren’t my absolute favorite — the OLED on the Garmin Epix 2 and the Epix Pro are much easier on the eyes. It’s admittedly tough to pick between the Fenix 7, Fenix 7 Pro, Epix 2, and Epix Pro lineups — especially now that the Epix Pro also has great battery life, the LED flashlight, and now comes in multiple sizes. What it boils down to is whether you prioritize a brighter display, longer battery life, or price.\nPersonally, I prefer the Epix Pro for better readability, but the Fenix 7 Pro is the better choice if this is your first introduction to Garmin’s platform. You’ll get better battery life, the same LED flashlight, all the same training features, and a lower starting price. (You can also check out our Garmin buying guide if you’d like even more alternatives.)\nTechnically, there’s a new Fenix 8 series on the block. That said, I still think the standard Fenix 7 or 7 Pro lineup is the better overall value. The Fenix 8 adds diving features and voice assistant capabilities, but it also ups the standard Fenix 7’s starting price of $650 by an additional $350. That’s tough to swallow, especially since retailers may offer discounts on older models to get rid of existing inventory.\nRead my full review of the Garmin Fenix 7S Pro.\nBest non-wrist tracker\nSizes: 12 proprietary sizes, 4–15, sizing kit needed / Weight: 4–6g (depends on size) / Battery life: Up to seven days / Display type: None / GPS: None / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: Up to 328 feet / Music storage: None\nThe vast majority of fitness trackers are worn on the wrist, but the $349 Oura Ring isn’t. The smart ring is a good option for people who are looking for something a little more discreet. It’s also less distracting than some other wrist-based options, as it lacks a screen and doesn’t mirror push notifications from your phone. \nThe new Oura Ring 4 isn’t functionally that much different from the previous Gen 3. It’s slimmer, features a new all-titanium design, has improved battery life, and has a new sensor algorithm that Oura says is more accurate. None of the new software features are gatekept to the Ring 4, so Gen 3 owners shouldn’t feel the need to upgrade unless their ring no longer lasts more than two days on a single charge. That said, the fourth-gen ring has an expanded size range spanning from 4 to 15. If you felt your Gen 3 was a bit snug or couldn’t find a size that fit right, you may have a better option now.\nWhile smaller than your average wearable, the Oura Ring still tracks a ton of metrics, including heart rate variability, body temperature, blood oxygen, all-day heart rate monitoring, and cycle tracking. Since launching, the Oura Ring has also added activity tracking, blood oxygen levels, chronotypes to help visualize your circadian rhythms, a social feature called Circles, improved stress tracking, cardiovascular age and capacity metrics, and even an AI chatbot (in beta). It’s also rolled out a new sleep stages algorithm that it claims is more accurate than before. The app has also been entirely revamped to better organize all these new features and metrics.\nThe Oura Ring tracks typical metrics — such as steps and calories burned —  but its main focus is sleep and recovery. Each day, you’re given three sets of scores for your readiness, sleep, and activity. It’s a simple, holistic look at your overall wellness and an ideal pick if you want a more hands-off experience with your data.\nIf you’ve got a Samsung Galaxy Watch, you may want to consider the $399.99 Galaxy Ring. It’s a bit more expensive than the base Oura Ring, but it doesn’t come with a subscription, and you get much better battery life when used with the Galaxy Watch. The hardware is also excellent, especially the charging case. That said, this is only an option for Android users, and even then, you don’t unlock its full potential unless you’ve got other Samsung gear. I also recommend the Ultrahuman Ring Air for folks who don’t like the idea of Oura’s monthly subscription.\nYou can read my experiences with a bunch of other smart rings, but right now, the Oura Ring is the most polished with the best overall experience.\nRead my full review of the Oura Ring 4.\nBest fitness band\nSize: 42mm x 24mm x 12.2mm with 16mm straps / Weight: 28g / Battery life: Up to 18 days / Display type: OLED / GPS: Tethered / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: None\nIt’s truly hard to beat the Amazfit Band 7’s $49.99 price — doubly so since you can often find it on sale for even less. Wearing the Band 7 feels like a throwback to 2014, which is great if all you’re looking for is a simple and casual tracker that won’t break the bank.\nNo one is going to compliment you on the Band 7’s design, but it’s got a handful of cute watch faces that make good use of its OLED touchscreen. And despite having an OLED display, you’ll still get roughly 14 days of battery life on a single charge. It’s also incredibly lightweight, making it a good option for sleep tracking as well.\nYou also get an absurd number of features for the price. That includes Amazon Alexa, continuous heart rate monitoring, blood oxygen monitoring, stress tracking, advanced sleep tracking, training metrics like VO2 max and load, abnormal heart rate alerts, menstrual tracking, push notifications, find my phone, a camera remote, and even a Pomodoro timer. You’re sacrificing contactless payments and will have to settle for tethered GPS, but this is a fair tradeoff considering everything else you’re getting. It’s not the best option for hardcore fitness tracking, but this is a great option if all you’re looking to do is casually track activity and your steps.\nAmazfit’s been making surprisingly good budget trackers for a while. That said, if you’re a little wary of a lesser-known brand, the $159.95 Fitbit Charge 6 is a decent alternative. It’s pricier, but you get a lot of what Amazfit is missing. That includes Google services like YouTube Music, Google Wallet, and Google Maps. Plus, it has built-in GPS and the ability to broadcast your heart rate with some Bluetooth-compatible gym equipment.\nRead my full review of the Amazfit Band 7.\nMost stylish fitness watch\nSizes: 37mm with 18mm straps  / Weight: 45g / Battery life: Up to 39 days / Display type:  OLED display / GPS: Tethered GPS / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: N/A\nThe $249.95 Withings ScanWatch Light is a fetching hybrid analog smartwatch. Think of it as a dressier fitness band with some Swatch-like design sensibilities. It’s got all your basics like simple push notifications, timers, and alarms. Plus, you can track steps, sleep, menstrual cycles, and GPS activities straight from the wrist. It looks spiffy on the wrist, and if you like a pop of color, Withings offers minty green and pale blue color options. It’s also got excellent battery life, with an estimated 30 days on a single charge. I got a little less in testing at around 25 days, but that’s still much better than the vast majority of flagship smartwatches. This also looks way more stylish than beefier multisport watches with similar battery life.\nAs its name suggests, the Light is a pared-down version of the $349.95 ScanWatch 2. The main things you’re missing are an EKG sensor for atrial fibrillation detection, a temperature sensor, blood oxygen tracking, and an altimeter for tracking elevation. For basic fitness tracking, you don’t really need those sensors. That’s why I think the extra $100 in savings is worth it for the Light, especially since both are lacking in safety features, contactless payments, and some other bells and whistles you can get from other watches in the $350 price range. That said, if you want extras, the ScanWatch 2 also gets you a slightly more elegant look thanks to the second step-counter dial.\nAnother option I like is the $179.99 Garmin Vivomove Sport, which actually dominated this category in the past few years. It’s hard to beat the price, especially since it gets you access to Garmin’s platform. However, Garmin’s “hidden” OLED display can get washed out in bright lighting, and battery life was significantly shorter than other hybrid analog watches at around five days. Still, if you’d prefer a platform with a focus on fitness rather than wellness, the Vivomove Sport may be the better move over a Withings watch.\nRead my full review of the Withings ScanWatch 2 and Light.\nBest fitness tracker for iPhone users\nSizes: 42mm, 46mm / Weight: 29.3g (42mm), 35.3g (46mm) / Battery life: Up to 18 hours / Display type: Always-on LTPO OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS, plus GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, Beidou / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: Up to 50 meters / Music storage: 32GB\nIf you’re looking for a smartwatch that does fitness well, then iPhone owners need to look no further than the $399 Apple Watch Series 10. (The LTE version costs $50 more.) This is another iterative update, but the Series 10 is a much more comfortable watch than previous models. It’s thinner and lighter, plus there’s a larger display. If you’ve got a Series 5 or older, now is a good time to upgrade.\nWith watchOS 11, there’s a new suite of training features. There’s Training Load, which gives you greater insight into how intensely you’ve been working out the past week compared to the last 28 days. There’s also a new Vitals app that flags when key metrics, like sleep duration or heart rate, may be out of whack. Plus, you can finally pause your rings for rest days. The software update also brings some savvy updates to the Smart Stack. For example, if you’re in a noisy cafe wondering what song’s playing, the Smart Stack can now surface the Shazaam widget. It also now supports Live Activities, turning your wrist into a mini Dynamic Island. Health-wise, we also now have FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection.\nOf course, we also have to address the Apple Watch ban. As of January 18th, 2024, new Apple Watches sold in the US have the blood oxygen feature disabled due to an ongoing patent battle with medical device maker Masimo. This isn’t a huge deal for most people, as this feature isn’t that useful for most people yet, and the new sleep apnea feature exclusively uses the accelerometer rather than the blood oxygen sensor. You might want to consider a refurbished Series 7 or 8 if blood oxygen sensing is important to you, however.\nIf you’re a first-time buyer, you can also opt for the second-gen Apple Watch SE. It’s slightly cheaper at $249, and while you don’t get as many features, it’s a good introduction to the ecosystem. Otherwise, if you’re the type of athlete who covets a Garmin, you may also want to consider splurging on the Apple Watch Ultra 2. It’s more expensive at $799, but it does have the brightest screen of any Apple Watch, comes with dual-frequency GPS, has diving and hiking safety features, and is made of more durable materials. There’s also a fetching new black color.\nRead my full review of the Apple Watch Series 10.\nBest fitness smartwatch for Samsung phones\nSizes: 47mm / Weight: 60.5g / Battery life: Up to 100 hours / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 10ATM, IP68 / Music storage: 32GB\nTruthfully, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra left me a bit disappointed after reviewing it — not because it’s a bad piece of hardware, but because it copies a bit too much from Apple. Even so, this is the most full-featured fitness smartwatch a Samsung phone owner can buy.\nWhile I prefer the Galaxy Watch 7 myself, I can’t say it’s the best for fitness tracking. There was too much of a gap between it and the Ultra in my testing as far as accuracy, especially for GPS tracking. But what really sealed the deal for me was the difference in battery life. It’s simply night and day, and the Galaxy Watch 7 really struggled in this arena. (The gaps are much less egregious between the base Apple Watch and Ultra 2.)\nThe caveat is, if all you want is casual fitness tracking, the Galaxy Watch 7 is the better choice for wearability. It’s just more comfortable for sleep tracking and lighter overall. Just keep in mind it lacks the Ultra’s emergency siren and shortcut button, and the screen doesn’t get quite as bright.\nWith both watches, you get a faster processor, a new 3-in-1 BioActive Sensor, some AI health features, and FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection. The newer hardware makes for a more futureproof purchase, but I found the AI health features to be hit-or-miss in practice. As always, some features, like EKGs and sleep apnea detection, are limited to Samsung owners. That makes this hard to wholeheartedly recommend this to non-Samsung Android users.\nBut if the Ultra doesn’t float your boat, now is a good time to find the Galaxy Watch 6 series, particularly the base models, on sale. The base Galaxy Watch 7 may have newer hardware, but as far as actual use goes, it’s not a massive update over the Watch 6. And if you’re into a physical rotating bezel, just go ahead and snag a Galaxy Watch 6 Classic.\nRead my full review of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.\nBest fitness smartwatch for Android\nSizes: 41mm, 45mm / Weight: 31g / Battery life: Up to 24 hours / Display type: Always-on OLED / GPS: Built-in GPS / Connectivity: LTE (optional), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi / Water resistance: 5ATM / Music storage: 32GB\nWith the Pixel Watch 3, Google is finally done playing catch-up.\nThere are truly too many updates to call each one out individually, but overall, they fall into two buckets: refinement and expansion. The hardware is mostly the same as the Pixel Watch 2 in terms of design. However, we now have a brighter screen, smaller bezels, and a new 45mm size. The larger size is quite nice, especially if you prefer larger screens without sacrificing wearability.\nBattery life is also better. There’s a new battery-saver mode that kicks in when you hit 15 percent, and the new displays are also more power efficient. Plus, bedtime mode is automatic now, so that helps the watch last longer overnight for sleep tracking. It’s only a modest improvement over the Pixel Watch 2, but it’s dramatic compared to the original.\nSoftware is where the Pixel Watch 3 makes the most updates. There are a ton of new fitness and health features, including a new running dashboard, custom running workouts, and AI-generated workout suggestions. There’s also a revamped Daily Readiness Score and a new Cardio Load metric, which gauges how intensely you’ve been exercising. For European users, you can also get the new Loss of Pulse feature, which calls emergency services on your behalf if it detects you no longer have a pulse. Unfortunately, this isn’t available stateside, as it hasn’t yet received FDA clearance.\nThe Pixel Watch 3 also better integrates with Google services and the Pixel ecosystem. You can now view your Nest Doorbell or Camera feed straight from the wrist — and it’s quite handy if you get a lot of packages or guests. If you have Google TV, you can use the watch as a remote. Now that the watch has an ultra wideband chip, it can also now unlock your Pixel phone. You can also use the Recorder app to capture audio and send it straight to your Pixel phone.\nThat said, some of these features now mean the Pixel Watch works best with a Pixel phone. If you’re looking for alternatives to Google and Samsung, the $299.99 OnePlus Watch 2 is a strong alternative. You’re giving up LTE, but it’s a handsome-looking watch with surprisingly long battery life and Google Assistant from the get-go.\nRead my full review of the Google Pixel Watch 3.\nBest for early adopters and elite athletes\nSizes: 43mm by 28mm by 10mm / Weight: 18g / Battery life: 4–5 days / Display type: None / GPS: None / Connectivity: Bluetooth / Water resistance: Up to 10 meters / Music storage: None\nThe Whoop 4.0 is not for the casual enthusiast. Not only does it come with an expensive monthly subscription, but the information it provides is only useful if you’re actively training for a cardio-intensive sport. If strength training is your main form of exercise, you’re better off looking elsewhere. Like the Oura Ring, this is a distraction-free tracker that specializes in sleep and recovery. The main difference is this has a more athletic bent. For instance, you’ll get way more insight into how much strain you’ve taken on in the past week. \nWhoop also provides a lot of novel ways to wear its tracker, including in underwear and arm/knee sleeves. This makes it an appealing option if you’re one of those unicorns who needs a secondary tracker to supplement another form of fitness tracking. Again, this is a tracker best appreciated by people who go hard and aren’t afraid to experiment. Plus, Whoop recently lowered its subscription prices in certain tiers, so while it’s still expensive, it’s not quite as pricey as it used to be.\nRead my full review of the Whoop 4.0.\nHow we test fitness trackers\nFitness trackers are meant to help you keep track of your health and activity. We do a mix of benchmark testing and experiential, real-life testing. That means snoozing with them, taking them out on GPS activities like runs and hikes, working up a sweat in several workouts, and comparing how they do against long-term control devices for heart rate, sleep, and GPS accuracy. Some factors we consider in our rankings are durability, performance, accuracy versus consistency in metrics, and of course, battery life. \nUpdate, March 3: Updated pricing and availability.","summary":"Fitness trackers have come a long way from the simple bands that tracked steps and little else.

Energy resources from Canada will also have a lower 10 percent tariff.\nTrump positioned the tariffs as a way to “halt the flood of poisonous drugs into the United States,” referring to fentanyl. The change will have a big impact on the cost of a wide variety of goods imported from each country, including electronics, produce, clothing, and much more.\nThough Trump previously said the tariffs will “enrich” citizens, consumers are expected to bear the brunt of the fees as they typically lead to higher prices.

actions, including halting enforcement of the TikTok ban and rolling back the Biden administration’s artificial intelligence order.\nHaving already run the country once before, Trump entered the presidency with the goal of hitting the ground running, having already selected nominees and chairs for key agencies that oversee tech. This time, Trump has the backing of many tech billionaires who attended his inauguration and showed up at his home in Mar-a-Lago.\nRead on below as we keep track of all the ways Trump is leaving his mark on tech in his first 100 days in office.\nTSMC announces $100 billion investment in US chipmaking\n\t\t\t\nFTC workers are getting terminated, including consumer protection and antitrust staff\n\t\t\t\nThe US faces ‘devastating’ losses for weather forecasts, federal workers say\n\t\t\t\nTrump reportedly plans to announce $100 billion chip deal with TSMC.\n\t\t\t\nUS government tech group 18F shuts down.\n\t\t\t\nVerizon becomes the FCC’s next DEI target.\n\t\t\t\nTrump names Bitcoin and others as part of coming ‘Crypto Strategic Reserve’\n\t\t\t\nFAA staff reportedly ordered to find funding for deal with Musk’s Starlink\n\t\t\t\nNew email tells federal employees to list recent accomplishments weekly\n\t\t\t\nDOGE wants to lay off the ‘vast majority’ of CFPB workers, employees say\n\t\t\t\nTed Cruz ‘investigation’ flagged mint research as ‘woke.’\n\t\t\t\nStarlink poised to take over $2.4 billion contract to overhaul air traffic control communication\n\t\t\t\nAntarctic research is at risk.\n\t\t\t\nWe finally know who’s legally running DOGE\n\t\t\t\nDonald Trump broke the law by removing climate change references from USDA websites, lawsuit alleges\n\t\t\t\nThe government is still threatening to ‘semi-fire’ workers who don’t answer an email from Elon Musk\n\t\t\t\nAbout that State Department ‘estimate’ for a $400 million order of armored Teslas.\n\t\t\t\nHow much of Apple’s ‘$500 billion commitment to our country’s future’ is actually new?\n\t\t\t\nSomeone flooded HUD HQ TVs with an AI-generated video of Trump and
