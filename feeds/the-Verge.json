In a<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/sandman-new-episodes\"> statement about the show coming to an end</a>, <em>Sandman </em>showrunner Allan Heinberg said that the series “has always been focused exclusively on Dream’s story, and back in 2022, when we looked at the remaining Dream material from the comics, we knew we only had enough story for one more season.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As <a href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-sandman-canceled-neil-gaiman-netflix-season-2-1236287571/\"><em>Variety </em>notes</a>, Netflix took its time before renewing <em>The Sandman </em>after its first season and did not announce a specific number of episodes it ordered. Netflix also made a point of referring to the renewal as “<a href=\"https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/the-sandman-renewed-season-2-netflix-1235386205/\">a continuation of <em>The Sandman</em> world</a>,” which at the time included the Dead Boy Detectives adaptation that was canceled<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/08/dead-boy-detectives-canceled-no-season-2-netflix-1236074383/\"> last August after a single season.</a> That all makes Heinberg’s statement sound plausible, but the timing of Netflix’s move to cancel <em>The Sandman </em>links it to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342844/a-difficult-read-on-neil-gaiman\">multiple allegations of sexual assault that Gaiman is currently facing</a>. In response to the allegations, <a href=\"https://journal.neilgaiman.com/\">Gaiman wrote in a blog post earlier this month</a>, “I’m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amazon made a similar decision last year when it first <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/good-omens-to-end-90-minute-episode-neil-gaiman-exits-1236157372/\">halted production on the third season</a> of its <em>Good Omens </em>(a Guiman novel co-written with Terry Pratchett) adaptation following earlier reporting about Gaiman’s actions, and ultimately decided to <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/10/good-omens-to-end-90-minute-episode-neil-gaiman-exits-1236157372/\">rework it into one 90-minute-long finale episode</a>. Disney also decided to <a href=\"https://www.indiewire.com/news/breaking-news/neil-gaiman-film-the-graveyard-book-sexual-assault-claims-1235043606/\">axe its plans to adapt Gaiman’s <em>The Graveyard Book</em></a>. More recently, Dark Horse Comics announced that it was <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/neil-gaiman-allegations-dark-horse-comics-7cfd2d359da5012f3c5200f46dbdb621\">dropping its series based on Gaiman’s <em>Anansi Boys</em></a>.

Tom Sturridge as Dream in episode 101 of The Sandman. | Image: Liam Daniel/Netflix © 2022<br>\n\nThough Netflix is planning to bring back a number of its ongoing series in the coming months, the streamer has decided to cancel its adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman.\nNetflix announced today that The Sandman will conclude with its upcoming second season. In a statement about the show coming to an end, Sandman showrunner Allan Heinberg said that the series “has always been focused exclusively on Dream’s story, and back in 2022, when we looked at the remaining Dream material from the comics, we knew we only had enough story for one more season.”\nAs Variety notes, Netflix took its time before renewing The Sandman after its first season and did not announce a specific number of episodes it ordered. Netflix also made a point of referring to the renewal as “a continuation of The Sandman world,” which at the time included the Dead Boy Detectives adaptation that was canceled last August after a single season. That all makes Heinberg’s statement sound plausible, but the timing of Netflix’s move to cancel The Sandman links it to the multiple allegations of sexual assault that Gaiman is currently facing. In response to the allegations, Gaiman wrote in a blog post earlier this month, “I’m far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.”\nAmazon made a similar decision last year when it first halted production on the third season of its Good Omens (a Guiman novel co-written with Terry Pratchett) adaptation following earlier reporting about Gaiman’s actions, and ultimately decided to rework it into one 90-minute-long finale episode. Disney also decided to axe its plans to adapt Gaiman’s The Graveyard Book. More recently, Dark Horse Comics announced that it was dropping its series based on Gaiman’s Anansi Boys. Amazon’s adaptation of Anansi Boys has been in development for ages and was intended to debut later this year, but it wouldn’t be surprising if those plans changed as well.","summary":"Though Netflix is planning to bring back a number of its ongoing series in the coming months, the streamer has decided to cancel its adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman.
