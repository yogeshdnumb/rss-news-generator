To her, the shift in messaging, and the squelching of this routine announcement, is alarming.</p>\n<p>“I’m a bit stunned by that language,” Nuzzo said. “No vaccine is without risk, but that makes it sound like it’s a very active coin toss of a decision. We’ve already had more cases of measles in 2025 than we had in 2024, and it’s spread to multiple states. It is not a coin toss at this point.”</p>\n<p>For many years, the CDC hasn’t minced words on vaccines. It <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html\">promoted them with confidence</a>. One campaign was called “<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/spotlights/2022-2023/ad-council-flu-campaign.htm\">Get My Flu Shot</a>.” The agency’s website <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-children/hcp/conversation-tips/index.html\">told medical providers</a> they play a critical role in helping parents choose vaccines for their children: “Instead of saying ‘What do you want to do about shots?,’ say ‘Your child needs three shots today.’”</p>\n<p>Nuzzo wishes the CDC’s forecasters would put out more details of their data and evidence on the spread of measles, not less. “The growing scale and severity of this measles outbreak and the urgent need for more data to guide the response underscores why we need a fully staffed and functional CDC and more resources for state and local health departments,” she said.</p>\n<p>Kennedy’s agency oversees the CDC and on Thursday announced it was poised to eliminate 2,400 jobs there.</p>\n<p>When asked what role, if any, Kennedy played in the decision to not release the risk assessment, HHS’s communications director said the aborted announcement “was part of an ongoing process to improve communication processes—nothing more, nothing less.” The CDC, he reiterated, continues to recommend vaccination “as the best way to protect against measles.”</p>\n<p>“Secretary Kennedy believes that the decision to vaccinate is a personal one and that people should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine,” Andrew G. Nixon said. “It is important that the American people have radical transparency and be informed to make personal healthcare decisions.”</p>\n<p>Responding to questions about criticism of the decision among some CDC staff, Nixon wrote, “Some individuals at the CDC seem more interested in protecting their own status or agenda rather than aligning with this Administration and the true mission of public health.”</p>\n<p>The CDC’s risk assessment was carried out by its Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which relied, in part, on new disease data from the outbreak in Texas. The CDC created the center to address a major shortcoming laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic. It functions like a National Weather Service for infectious diseases, harnessing data and expertise to predict the course of outbreaks like a meteorologist warns of storms.</p>\n<p>Other risk assessments by the center have been posted by the CDC even though their conclusions might seem obvious.</p>\n<p>In late February, for example, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cfa-qualitative-assessments/php/data-research/h5-risk-assessment.html\">forecasters analyzing the spread of H5N1</a> bird flu said people who come “in contact with potentially infected animals or contaminated surfaces or fluids” faced a moderate to high risk of contracting the disease. The risk to the general US population, they said, was low.</p>\n<p>In the case of the measles assessment, modelers at the center determined the risk of the disease for the general public in the US is low, but they found the risk is high in communities with low vaccination rates that are near outbreaks or share close social ties to those areas with outbreaks. The CDC had moderate confidence in the assessment, according to an internal Q&amp;A that explained the findings. The agency, it said, lacks detailed data about the onset of the illness for all patients in West Texas and is still learning about the vaccination rates in affected communities as well as travel and social contact among those infected. (The H5N1 assessment was also made with moderate confidence.)</p>\n<p>The internal plan to roll out the news of the forecast called for the expert physician who’s leading the CDC’s response to measles to be the chief spokesperson answering questions. “It is important to note that at local levels, vaccine coverage rates may vary considerably, and pockets of unvaccinated people can exist even in areas with high vaccination coverage overall,” the plan said. “The best way to protect against measles is to get the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.”</p>\n<p>This week, though, as the number of confirmed cases rose to 483, more than 30 agency staff were told in an email that after a discussion in the CDC director’s office, “leadership does not want to pursue putting this on the website.”</p>\n<p>The cancellation was “not normal at all,” said a CDC staff member who spoke anonymously for fear of reprisal with layoffs looming. “I’ve never seen a rollout plan that was canceled at that far along in the process.”</p>\n<p>Anxiety among CDC staff has been building over whether the agency will bend its public health messages to match those of Kennedy, a lawyer who founded an anti-vaccine group and referred clients to a law firm suing a vaccine manufacturer.</p>\n<p>During Kennedy’s first week on the job, HHS halted the CDC campaign that encouraged people to get flu shots during a ferocious flu season.

The virus can linger in the air for two hours after an infected person has left an area, and patients can spread measles before they even know they have it.\nThis week Amtrak said it was notifying customers that they may have been exposed to the disease this month when a passenger with measles rode one of its trains from New York City to Washington, DC.\n\n \nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Patricia Callahan, ProPublica\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/the-cdc-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations/#comments","content":"\n            The move is a sign that the public health agency may be falling in line under RFK Jr.\n          ","contentSnippet":"The move is a sign that the public health agency may be falling in line under RFK Jr.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/the-cdc-buried-a-measles-forecast-that-stressed-the-need-for-vaccinations/","categories":["Health","CDC","measles","measles anti-vaccine","measles outbreak","rfk jr","syndication"],"isoDate":"2025-03-29T10:50:17.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jon Brodkin\n        ","title":"Elon Musk’s X has a new owner—Elon Musk’s xAI","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/elon-musks-x-has-a-new-owner-elon-musks-xai/","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Mar 2025 23:59:49 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Elon Musk today said he has merged X and xAI in a deal that values the social network formerly known as Twitter at $33 billion.

The company has just announced two of its home gadgets will be discontinued, one of which is quite popular. The Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector is a common fixture in homes, but Google says it has stopped manufacturing it. The less popular Nest x Yale smart lock is also getting the ax. There are replacements coming, but Google won't be making them.\nNest launched the 2nd gen Protect a year before it became part of Google. Like all smoke detectors, the Nest Protect comes with an expiration date. You're supposed to swap them out every 10 years, so some Nest users are already there. You will have to hurry if you want a new Protect. While they're in stock for the moment, Google won't manufacture any more.
