They’ll maintain their two-way revenue-sharing setup (it's been <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-wrangle-over-terms-of-their-blockbuster-partnership?rc=mshudk\">reported</a> that Microsoft gets 20 percent of OpenAI’s revenue). Prior to today’s change, OpenAI was locked into using Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure exclusively for its computing needs. </p>\n<p id=\"fEU93e\">The news follows <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348816/openai-softbank-ai-data-center-stargate-project\">the announcement of a joint venture</a> between Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI to build a system of data centers in the U.S. called Starbase.</p>\n<p id=\"JeihBX\">The models OpenAI hopes to build and the user base it's looking to serve require billions of dollars in compute. It has been <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-eases-away-from-microsoft-data-centers?rc=mshudk\">previously reported</a> that some OpenAI shareholders felt Microsoft wasn’t moving fast enough to supply OpenAI with computing power, hence why the startup <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/12/24177188/openai-oracle-ai-chips-microsoft\">partnered with Oracle back in June</a> (with the blessing of Microsoft) for the necessary compute.</p>\n<p id=\"1Eteci\">There’s been a lot of buzz about Microsoft and OpenAI facing relationship woes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was briefly ousted from the company, causing a lot of very public drama. <em>The New York Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/17/technology/microsoft-openai-partnership-deal.html\">reported</a> that the relationship has grown increasingly strained due to financial pressures at OpenAI, concerns about stability, and growing friction between employees at both companies.</p>\n<p id=\"cVFJ2Y\">Last March, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/19/24105900/google-deepmind-microsoft-mustafa-suleyman-ai-ceo\">Microsoft hired Inflection CEO Mustafa Suleyman</a> to lead its consumer AI efforts, along with most of Inflection’s staff, in a $650 million deal. According to <em>The New York Times </em>report, this move particularly angered some OpenAI leadership, including Altman.</p>\n<p id=\"52ECy3\">OpenAI’s deal with Microsoft also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/26/24329618/openai-microsoft-and-the-100-billion-agi-question\">has an unusual escape clause</a>: if OpenAI creates artificial general intelligence (AGI), it could close off Microsoft’s access to some of its most powerful models developed after that point. AGI, reportedly, is defined as a system capable of <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-wrangle-over-terms-of-their-blockbuster-partnership\">generating more than $100 billion</a> in profits.

They’ll maintain their two-way revenue-sharing setup (it's been reported that Microsoft gets 20 percent of OpenAI’s revenue). Prior to today’s change, OpenAI was locked into using Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure exclusively for its computing needs. \nThe news follows the announcement of a joint venture between Arm, Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle, and OpenAI to build a system of data centers in the U.S. called Starbase.\nThe models OpenAI hopes to build and the user base it's looking to serve require billions of dollars in compute. It has been previously reported that some OpenAI shareholders felt Microsoft wasn’t moving fast enough to supply OpenAI with computing power, hence why the startup partnered with Oracle back in June (with the blessing of Microsoft) for the necessary compute.\nThere’s been a lot of buzz about Microsoft and OpenAI facing relationship woes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was briefly ousted from the company, causing a lot of very public drama. The New York Times reported that the relationship has grown increasingly strained due to financial pressures at OpenAI, concerns about stability, and growing friction between employees at both companies.\nLast March, Microsoft hired Inflection CEO Mustafa Suleyman to lead its consumer AI efforts, along with most of Inflection’s staff, in a $650 million deal. According to The New York Times report, this move particularly angered some OpenAI leadership, including Altman.\nOpenAI’s deal with Microsoft also has an unusual escape clause: if OpenAI creates artificial general intelligence (AGI), it could close off Microsoft’s access to some of its most powerful models developed after that point. AGI, reportedly, is defined as a system capable of generating more than $100 billion in profits. This was originally meant to keep such powerful AI from being commercialized, but now OpenAI is reportedly considering dropping this provision, likely to secure more Microsoft funding.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24349006/microsoft-openai-compute-partnership","isoDate":"2025-01-21T23:29:47.000Z"},{"title":"OpenAI and Softbank are starting a $500 billion AI data center company","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348816/openai-softbank-ai-data-center-stargate-project","pubDate":"2025-01-21T22:45:54.000Z","author":"Richard Lawler","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Donald Trump standing off to the side while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks behind a lectern at the White House.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avxUA3-DGj_6mzMAZxiUQO8jcYo=/14x0:1601x1058/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73859905/videoframe_1799876.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Image: The White House (<a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5gMiDnYEds\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>)</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"Tb2t6O\">A plan to build a system of data centers for artificial intelligence has been revealed in a White House press conference, with Masayoshi Son, Sam Altman, and Larry Ellison joining Donald Trump to announce The Stargate Project.

The company’s letter to investors says it accounts for less than 10 percent of TV viewing in the countries it’s available in, “which suggests a long runway for growth as streaming continues to expand around the world.”\nAlong with the price hike, Netflix announced that it’s rolling out a new Extra Member with Ads plan, which will allow those on the ad-supported plan to add someone outside their household to their subscription. It currently costs an extra $7.99 per month to add someone outside your household to an ad-free plan.\nThe streamer ended 2024 with a strong content lineup that included new seasons of Squid Game and the League of Legends spinoff Arcane.\nNetflix’s approach to live content has also gotten more aggressive within the past several weeks, as it has gone from airing “sports-adjacent” events like a golf tournament that paired PGA players with Formula One drivers to full-blown NFL games featuring performances from Beyoncé and Mariah Carey. But Netflix notes that it’s “not focusing on acquiring rights to large regular season sports packages; rather, our live strategy is all about delivering can’t-miss, special event programming.”\nDespite running into some hiccups, the streamer also touted “record-breaking” viewership numbers for last year’s live boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul, while its WWE debut with Monday Night Raw locked in 4.9 million views, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\nUpdate, January 21st: Added information from Netflix.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348682/netflix-price-increase-earnings-q4-2024","isoDate":"2025-01-21T21:13:37.000Z"},{"title":"The Switch 2 has a new trigger for disconnecting Joy-Con controllers","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348868/nintendo-switch-2-new-trigger-disconnecting-joy-con-controllers","pubDate":"2025-01-21T20:50:33.000Z","author":"Jay Peters","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LSLmqq53wFh4UaXD1mSGQ6S-DCk=/0x87:2216x1564/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73859715/Screenshot_2025_01_21_at_12.44.53_PM.0.png\" />\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"ISKNjd\">A video on <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/index.html\">Nintendo’s Switch 2 website</a> shows how the trigger (or is it a button?) on the back of the Joy-Con controllers disconnects them from the console, as spotted <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/511597/switch-2-nintendo-joy-con-remove-detach\">by <em>Polygon</em></a>.</p>\n<p id=\"YIJAsX\">In the video, the trigger is pressed down a tad before a final push releases it from the console.
