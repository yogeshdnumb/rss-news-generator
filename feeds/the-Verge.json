But the company is planning a Nintendo Switch 2-focused Direct on April 2nd.\nThe first Nintendo Switch will be a tough act to follow. With more than 130 million units sold, the hybrid tablet has become the company’s bestselling console to date, besting the Wii, and slowly but surely approaching the DS handheld.\nNintendo infamously followed the Wii with the ill-fated Wii U before turning things around with the Switch. And the console went out on a high note following the release of blockbusters The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder. It seems like the Switch 2 is primed to carry on that legacy, but hopefully we don’t have to wait too much longer after that April Direct for an official release.\nKeep up with all of the latest Switch 2 developments right here.\nGold is so old.\n\t\t\t\nThe Switch 2 has a new trigger for disconnecting Joy-Con controllers\n\t\t\t\nHere’s how to play the Switch 2 early\n\t\t\t\nSome of the Switch’s 2 first accessories are all about Mario Kart\n\t\t\t\nNintendo’s Switch 2 is here — sort of\n\t\t\t\nWant to know when you can preorder the Switch 2?\n\t\t\t\nAll our unanswered questions about the Nintendo Switch 2\n\t\t\t\nThe Switch 2 is almost here — but PC handhelds are giving it big competition\n\t\t\t\nThe Switch 2’s bigger screen is just what I wanted\n\t\t\t\nThe Switch 2 is boring — and that’s exactly what Nintendo needs\n\t\t\t\nWhenever the Switch 2 comes out, it’ll have competition from handheld PCs.\n\t\t\t\nThe Switch 2’s snap sound is *chef’s kiss*.\n\t\t\t\nHere’s our video about the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\t\t\t\nEverything we know about the Switch 2’s Joy-Con controllers\n\t\t\t\nYou’ll be able to try out the Switch 2 starting in April\n\t\t\t\nNintendo teases a new Mario Kart for the Switch 2\n\t\t\t\nNintendo announces Switch 2 Direct for April\n\t\t\t\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 supports original Switch cartridges\n\t\t\t\nGet ready for the Switch 2 announcement this week.\n\t\t\t\nEverything we know (and think we know) about the Nintendo Switch 2\n\t\t\t\nThe Switch 2 leaks keep coming\n\t\t\t\nIs this the Nintendo Switch 2?\n\t\t\t\nThat’s a nice blue.\n\t\t\t\nNew year, new alleged Switch 2 leak.\n\t\t\t\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 and its dock, as described by the mystery Reddit leaker\n\t\t\t\nThe Nintendo Switch 2, as described by Dbrand\n\t\t\t\nNintendo says the Switch successor will be compatible with Switch games\n\t\t\t\nNext-gen Nintendo?\n\t\t\t\nI’ve given up on trying to predict what Nintendo will do — especially when it comes to the Switch 2\n\t\t\t\nWhat’s this new mystery Nintendo device?\n\t\t\t\nNintendo bides time until Switch 2.\n\t\t\t\nSwitch 2 will be revealed before April 2025, promises Nintendo\n\t\t\t\nIs Nintendo going off the rails?\n\t\t\t\nNo Nintendo Switch 2 at Gamescom.\n\t\t\t\nCould Pokémon Legends: Z-A be coming to a Switch 2 near you?\n\t\t\t\nNintendo fans might be waiting at least a year for the next Switch console\n\t\t\t\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 will now reportedly arrive in 2025 instead of 2024\n\t\t\t\nNintendo says Switch will continue to be its “main business” heading into 2024 as next-gen rumors mount.\n\t\t\t\nI love this theory that Metroid Prime 4 could be a cross-gen Switch 2 launch title.\n\t\t\t\nAnalyst tips 8-inch LCD for Nintendo Switch 2.\n\t\t\t\nWith a Switch 2 looming, Nintendo is sending out the original with a bang\n\t\t\t\nActivision was briefed on Nintendo’s Switch 2 last year\n\t\t\t\nNintendo Switch 2 evidence grows with rumors of developer demos\n\t\t\t\nNintendo’s next-gen console could come as soon as 2024\n\t\t\t\nThe Steam Deck’s FSR vividly shows why a Nintendo Switch Pro would rule\n\t\t\t\nNintendo categorically denies that a 4K Switch Pro is in development\n\t\t\t\nThe Switch Pro was real, Bloomberg reports\n\t\t\t\nDon’t count out the Nintendo Switch Pro\n\t\t\t\nWhat we actually want from an upgraded Nintendo Switch\n\t\t\t\nNintendo says it has no plans for a new Switch this year","summary":"The Nintendo Switch 2 has finally been announced, and it will launch sometime in 2025.

Before you know it, you’re spending as much on streaming as you would on cable.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you’re trying to cut down on your expenses (and who isn’t these days?), you don’t necessarily need to unsubscribe from everything. In fact, we’ve found a few ways for you to save on your monthly subscriptions.&nbsp;It turns out a variety of platforms are offering ongoing promos, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie without worrying about breaking the bank.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#4mn8ET\">The best Peacock deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-sling-tv-deals\">The best Sling TV deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#LBAzGk\">The best Apple TV Plus deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#SzBZcn\">The best Disney Plus deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#RXNJjq\">The best Hulu deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#eNno1C\">The best Max deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#4cXZwR\">The best Netflix deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-youtube-tv-deals\">The best YouTube TV deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#paramount-plus-and-showtime-1\">The best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#GdeXL7\">The best Starz deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#the-best-amazon-prime-video-deals\">The best Amazon Prime Video deals</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Quick note: keep an eye out for free trials and student discounts</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. In all instances, however, you will have to provide your credit card information in advance. You will also automatically be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar to cancel your subscription if you’re unhappy with the service.</p>\n\n<p>Some platforms, though not all, also offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your eligibility and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"4mn8ET\">The best Peacock deals</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Peacock</strong> is NBCUniversal’s streaming service, one that offers&nbsp;next-day programming from NBC (and Bravo). The platform also provides access to live sports programming, including Sunday Night Football&nbsp;and WWE, as well as movies and shows like <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/3/24334991/the-wild-robot-peacock-streaming-debut-theatrical-rerelease\">The Wild Robot</a></em>, <em>Conclave</em>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275860/twisters-will-swirl-onto-peacock-this-november\"><em>Twisters</em></a>, <em>Oppenheimer</em>, <em>Yellowstone</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24205137/teacup-date-teaser-peacock-horror-sdcc-2024\"><em>Teacup</em></a>, <em>The Office</em>, <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, and Rian Johnson’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23558961/poker-face-peacock-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Poker Face</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The platform currently <a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/plans/all-monthly?irclickid=wrcyn-XE-zmJTYK1p8yXa2mqUkAwE5W5rxi5QA0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=pk_vrs_imra&amp;utm_medium=pd_aff_acq_psdlnk&amp;utm_term=Vox%20Media&amp;utm_content=828265&amp;cid=2201affiliateevgnpkpdaff4393&amp;utm_campaign=2201affiliateevgn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">offers two distinct plans</a>: an ad-supported Peacock Premium tier for $7.99 a month (or $79.99 a year) or the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier for $13.99 a month (or $139.99 a year). Only the latter lets you download content for offline viewing, however.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of discounts, new and lapsed subscribers can get&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.peacocktv.com/\">a year of ad-supported&nbsp;Peacock Premium</a>&nbsp;for $29.99 ($50 off), so long&nbsp;as they sign up before February 19th. Current Peacock Premium and Premium Plus subscribers are not eligible for this deal; however, those with free Peacock accounts are able to take advantage of the ongoing promo when they use code&nbsp;<strong>WINTERSAVINGS</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re not eligible for the current Peacock promo, you can also grab a complimentary subscription when you sign up for a year of Instacart Plus ($99 annually or $9.99 a month). You <a href=\"https://www.xfinity.com/support/articles/peacock-premium-offers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">can also get free access</a> if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer with gigabit speeds or you’re a Diamond or Platinum Rewards member.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-sling-tv-deals\">The best Sling TV deals</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Sling TV</strong> is a streaming service that functions as a more affordable alternative to YouTube TV and Hulu with Live TV. With it, you can watch a range of streaming services as well as live and on-demand channels — including ESPN, CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, and Cartoon Network — on multiple devices.</p>\n\n<p>Sling offers an ad-supported free tier —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sling-tv.pxf.io/c/482924/1132376/14334?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sling.com%2Ffreestream&amp;subid1=VergeBestStreamingDeals021423\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sling Freestream</a> — which provides access to more than 500 live channels as well as more than 40,000 on-demand movies and TV shows. The platform also offers three paid plans, all of which come with 50 hours of DVR storage: Sling Blue ($50.99 a month); Sling Orange ($45.99 a month); and Sling Orange and Blue ($65.99 a month). Sling <a href=\"https://www.sling.com/programming/max?bs=1&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_content=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAqrG9BhAVEiwAaPu5zkA0LN82eAk9_QQxBV1jEHo21WFgXDCrPUwCgz8hGScllA7ozqgkaBoCVZEQAvD_BwE\">also lets you subscribe to Max as an add-on</a> for a discount, or you can buy an ad-free subscription to Max as a standalone service for $16.99 a month. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re into sports, you may want to opt for Sling Orange over Blue as it grants access to ESPN channels — but only on one device. Sling Blue, however, offers a number of channels Sling Orange lacks, including Fox News, MSNBC, E!, Discovery, Bravo, and local NBC or Fox affiliates. You can also subscribe to a bundle that includes both Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which offers all of the channels the first two plans feature.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To celebrate its 10th anniversary, Sling is taking $10 off the first month of Sling Orange or Blue through February 28th. The service is also throwing in a complementary month of Max (valued at $16.99 a month) and unlimited DVR storage (an extra $5 a month), as well as access to AMC Plus for the rest of the year. This deal is available to both new customers, as well as past Sling TV subscribers who haven’t been a subscriber within the past 12 months.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, new subscribers can get a month of Sling Orange with a free month of Max and unlimited DVR storage for just $35.99 for their first month, which equates to a $42 discount. If you subscribe to Sling Blue, you’ll pay $40.99 ($32 off) for your first month, or $55.99 ($32 off) if you subscribe to both plans.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"LBAzGk\">The best Apple TV Plus deals</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Apple TV Plus</strong> is a service owned by Apple that streams original shows and movies in 4K HDR, including <em>Ted Lasso,&nbsp;The Morning Show,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24177603/silo-season-2-apple-tv-plus-premiere-date-sdcc-2024\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Silo</em></a><em>,</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22929661/severance-review-apple-tv-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Severance</em></a>, <em>Finch</em>, <em>Coda, </em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/16/23075072/for-all-mankind-season-3-is-set-in-the-90s-but-seems-focused-on-a-very-2020s-space-race\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>For All Mankind,</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231523/napoleon-the-directors-cut-has-invaded-apple-tv-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Napoleo</em>n</a>.

For instance, new and returning subscribers can currently get <a href=\"https://howl.link/pg8k0ri5n8h89\">three months of Apple TV Plus for free at Best Buy</a>. You can also get a free three-month subscription when you buy an Apple device, though you’ll have to redeem the offer within 90 days.</p>\n\n<p>Apple TV Plus is also included in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-one%2F&amp;subid1=vergebeststreaming092022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Apple&nbsp;One</a>, which lets you bundle up to four other Apple services for a single monthly subscription starting at $19.95. You’ll also get a free month of Apple TV Plus if you buy it as a part of Apple One. In addition, eligible individuals who <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sign up for the student Apple Music subscription</a>, which starts at $5.99 per month, can get Apple Music for 50 percent off with a free Apple TV Plus subscription.</p>\n\n<p>As far as carrier deals go, T-Mobile offers discounts on Apple TV Plus, as well as other streaming services. For instance, the wireless carrier is <a href=\"https://www.t-mobile.com/benefits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">currently offering customers</a> in the US complimentary access to Apple TV Plus when they subscribe to a qualifying Go5G Next line.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SzBZcn\">The best Disney Plus deals</h2>\n\n<p>With <strong>Disney Plus</strong>, you can stream a wide range of shows and movies, including <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24312202/star-wars-skeleton-crew-review\">Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</a></em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24204339/deadpool-wolverine-review-xmen-marvel-mcu\"><em>Deadpool</em>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<em>Wolverine</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24157272/x-men-97-season-one-finale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>X-Men ‘97</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tv/606081/your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-community-justice\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theverge.com/tv/606081/your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-community-justice\">Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</a></em>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065421/taylor-swift-eras-tour-streaming-disney-plus-announced\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film</a>. A monthly Disney Plus subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As far as bundles go, <a href=\"https://help.disneyplus.com/article/disneyplus-disney-bundle#price\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disney also offers</a> an ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Disney Bundle Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu, which you can get ad-free for an extra $9 per month. There’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying an extra $10 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you plan on subscribing to all three.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, there are other ways to save. For instance, those currently on <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeStreamingServiceDeals011223/https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/\">one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans</a> can get the Legacy Disney Bundle <a href=\"https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/disneyplus/\">for $10 a month</a>. The bundle — which includes ad-free Disney Plus, Hulu with ads, and ad-supported ESPN Plus — typically costs $21.99 a month, so you’re effectively saving $11.99. Note, however, that the deal is only available to existing subscribers who enrolled in this plan before it was discontinued.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"RXNJjq\">The best Hulu deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Hulu</strong> offers both <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;offerid=852731.646&amp;type=3&amp;u1=Verge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-supported and ad-free plans</a>. No matter which you buy, you’ll be able to access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices, including originals like <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/611243/the-handmaids-tale-season-6-premiere-date-trailer\">The Handmaid’s Tale</a> </em>and<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24141497/sand-land-game-anime-hulu-ps5-xbox-akira-toriyama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Sand Land</em></a><em>, </em>as well as non-Hulu content like <em>Shogun</em>, <em>The Bear</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24206898/futurama-season-12-review-hulu-nft-ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Futurama</em></a>, and <em>The Veil</em>. The service also allows two people to stream simultaneously, and you can have up to six user profiles. However, subscribing to the ad-free plan means you won’t have to deal with commercials; you’ll also be able to watch downloads offline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Right now, the <a href=\"https://help.hulu.com/article/hulu-what-is-hulu#features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-supported plan</a> runs $9.99 per month, while the <a href=\"https://help.hulu.com/article/hulu-no-ads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ad-free plan</a> costs $18.99 a month. Hulu also sells ad-free and ad-supported bundles that include Disney Plus and / or ESPN Plus, which are cheaper than subscribing to each service individually.

And while it’s true that most streaming services don’t cost much in comparison to most of the tech we cover, we all know monthly subscription fees have a way of adding up. Before you know it, you’re spending as much on streaming as you would on cable.\nHowever, if you’re trying to cut down on your expenses (and who isn’t these days?), you don’t necessarily need to unsubscribe from everything. In fact, we’ve found a few ways for you to save on your monthly subscriptions. It turns out a variety of platforms are offering ongoing promos, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie without worrying about breaking the bank.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Peacock deals\nThe best Sling TV deals\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nThe best Hulu deals\nThe best Max deals\nThe best Netflix deals\nThe best YouTube TV deals\nThe best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals\nThe best Starz deals\nThe best Amazon Prime Video deals\n\nQuick note: keep an eye out for free trials and student discounts\nMost streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. In all instances, however, you will have to provide your credit card information in advance. You will also automatically be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar to cancel your subscription if you’re unhappy with the service.\nSome platforms, though not all, also offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your eligibility and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals.\nThe best Peacock deals\nPeacock is NBCUniversal’s streaming service, one that offers next-day programming from NBC (and Bravo). The platform also provides access to live sports programming, including Sunday Night Football and WWE, as well as movies and shows like The Wild Robot, Conclave,  Twisters, Oppenheimer, Yellowstone, Teacup, The Office, Saturday Night Live, and Rian Johnson’s Poker Face.\nThe platform currently offers two distinct plans: an ad-supported Peacock Premium tier for $7.99 a month (or $79.99 a year) or the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier for $13.99 a month (or $139.99 a year). Only the latter lets you download content for offline viewing, however.\nIn terms of discounts, new and lapsed subscribers can get a year of ad-supported Peacock Premium for $29.99 ($50 off), so long as they sign up before February 19th. Current Peacock Premium and Premium Plus subscribers are not eligible for this deal; however, those with free Peacock accounts are able to take advantage of the ongoing promo when they use code WINTERSAVINGS.\nIf you’re not eligible for the current Peacock promo, you can also grab a complimentary subscription when you sign up for a year of Instacart Plus ($99 annually or $9.99 a month). You can also get free access if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer with gigabit speeds or you’re a Diamond or Platinum Rewards member.\nThe best Sling TV deals\nSling TV is a streaming service that functions as a more affordable alternative to YouTube TV and Hulu with Live TV. With it, you can watch a range of streaming services as well as live and on-demand channels — including ESPN, CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, and Cartoon Network — on multiple devices.\nSling offers an ad-supported free tier — Sling Freestream — which provides access to more than 500 live channels as well as more than 40,000 on-demand movies and TV shows. The platform also offers three paid plans, all of which come with 50 hours of DVR storage: Sling Blue ($50.99 a month); Sling Orange ($45.99 a month); and Sling Orange and Blue ($65.99 a month). Sling also lets you subscribe to Max as an add-on for a discount, or you can buy an ad-free subscription to Max as a standalone service for $16.99 a month. \nIf you’re into sports, you may want to opt for Sling Orange over Blue as it grants access to ESPN channels — but only on one device. Sling Blue, however, offers a number of channels Sling Orange lacks, including Fox News, MSNBC, E!, Discovery, Bravo, and local NBC or Fox affiliates. You can also subscribe to a bundle that includes both Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which offers all of the channels the first two plans feature.\nTo celebrate its 10th anniversary, Sling is taking $10 off the first month of Sling Orange or Blue through February 28th. The service is also throwing in a complementary month of Max (valued at $16.99 a month) and unlimited DVR storage (an extra $5 a month), as well as access to AMC Plus for the rest of the year. This deal is available to both new customers, as well as past Sling TV subscribers who haven’t been a subscriber within the past 12 months.\nIn summary, new subscribers can get a month of Sling Orange with a free month of Max and unlimited DVR storage for just $35.99 for their first month, which equates to a $42 discount. If you subscribe to Sling Blue, you’ll pay $40.99 ($32 off) for your first month, or $55.99 ($32 off) if you subscribe to both plans.\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nApple TV Plus is a service owned by Apple that streams original shows and movies in 4K HDR, including Ted Lasso, The Morning Show, Silo, Severance, Finch, Coda, For All Mankind, and Napoleon. The platform also is the streaming home to Major League Soccer, and currently costs $9.99 a month.\nThere are a couple of promos to make note of when it comes to Apple TV Plus. For instance, new and returning subscribers can currently get three months of Apple TV Plus for free at Best Buy. You can also get a free three-month subscription when you buy an Apple device, though you’ll have to redeem the offer within 90 days.\nApple TV Plus is also included in Apple One, which lets you bundle up to four other Apple services for a single monthly subscription starting at $19.95. You’ll also get a free month of Apple TV Plus if you buy it as a part of Apple One. In addition, eligible individuals who sign up for the student Apple Music subscription, which starts at $5.99 per month, can get Apple Music for 50 percent off with a free Apple TV Plus subscription.\nAs far as carrier deals go, T-Mobile offers discounts on Apple TV Plus, as well as other streaming services. For instance, the wireless carrier is currently offering customers in the US complimentary access to Apple TV Plus when they subscribe to a qualifying Go5G Next line.\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nWith Disney Plus, you can stream a wide range of shows and movies, including Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, Deadpool & Wolverine, X-Men ‘97, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film. A monthly Disney Plus subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). \nAs far as bundles go, Disney also offers an ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Disney Bundle Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu, which you can get ad-free for an extra $9 per month. There’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying an extra $10 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you plan on subscribing to all three.\nThat being said, there are other ways to save. For instance, those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans can get the Legacy Disney Bundle for $10 a month. The bundle — which includes ad-free Disney Plus, Hulu with ads, and ad-supported ESPN Plus — typically costs $21.99 a month, so you’re effectively saving $11.99. Note, however, that the deal is only available to existing subscribers who enrolled in this plan before it was discontinued.\nThe best Hulu deals\nHulu offers both ad-supported and ad-free plans. No matter which you buy, you’ll be able to access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices, including originals like The Handmaid’s Tale and Sand Land, as well as non-Hulu content like Shogun, The Bear, Futurama, and The Veil. The service also allows two people to stream simultaneously, and you can have up to six user profiles. However, subscribing to the ad-free plan means you won’t have to deal with commercials; you’ll also be able to watch downloads offline.\nRight now, the ad-supported plan runs $9.99 per month, while the ad-free plan costs $18.99 a month. Hulu also sells ad-free and ad-supported bundles that include Disney Plus and / or ESPN Plus, which are cheaper than subscribing to each service individually. With the Hulu with Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus bundle, you’ll be able to access more than 90 live sports, news, and entertainment channels, as well as Hulu, ESPN Plus, and Disney Plus content. You’ll also be able to record live shows with unlimited DVR storage and take advantage of the same features the standard, ad-free, and ad-supported Hulu plans offer. The ad-supported Hulu with Live TV subscription is $82.99 a month, while the ad-free tier is $95.99 a month.\nHowever, if you just want Hulu and don’t need the live TV version, you can subscribe to the ad-supported Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney Plus, for $10.99 a month. You can also add ESPN Plus for $16.99 per month, or get rid of ads and add live sports for $26.99 a month.\nIn terms of deals, students can subscribe to the ad-supported version for $1.99 a month or a bundle that combines Spotify Premium, Showtime, and ad-supported Hulu for $5.99 a month. Some wireless carriers are also offering customers discounts when they buy premium phone plans. As mentioned previously, Verizon grants you access to the Legacy Disney Bundle for $10 a month when you opt for one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans. That bundle includes ad-free Disney Plus, Hulu with ads, and ad-supported ESPN Plus. However, the deal is only available to existing subscribers who were already enrolled in this plan. T-Mobile, meanwhile, is offering complimentary access to Hulu’s ad-supported tier when you maintain a qualifying Go5G Next line. \nThe best Max deals\nMax, formerly known as HBO Max, is home to Game of Thrones and its spinoff, House of the Dragon, along with shows and movies like Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Dune: Prophecy, The Last of Us, Wonka, Euphoria, Hacks, Scavenger’s Reign, The Batman, Succession, and even content from Discovery Plus.\nThe platform offers an ad-supported tier that costs $9.99 a month and two ad-free plans that start at $16.99 a month. Unlike the ad-supported plan, the standard ad-free tier also lets you download 30 shows or movies for offline viewing. Max also offers a $20.99-a-month Premium plan, which allows you to stream in 4K Ultra HD and supports Dolby Atmos with select content. The latter plan also lets you stream on four devices simultaneously and download a maximum of 100 shows or movies to watch on the go.\nMax also offers an annual subscription and various bundles, both of which drop the price. The ad-supported plan costs $99.99 a year, saving you a modest $19 over the course of 12 months, while subscribing to the annual ad-free base plan for $169.99 saves you $33. You can also save about $41 by subscribing to the annual Ultimate Ad-Free plan for $209.99. Lastly, you can opt for the ad-supported bundle that contains Max, Disney Plus, and Hulu for $16.99 a month, or pay $13 extra a month to get rid of ads. The combined total is cheaper than subscribing to all three individually, thus saving you some money in the long run.\nMax isn’t currently offering a discount, but multiple wireless carriers are offering deals. You can, for instance, get a year of both Netflix and Max when you purchase a 5G Home Plus, LTE Home Plus, Fios 1 Gig, or the Fios 2 Gig Verizon Home Internet (VHI) plan. AT&T also includes complimentary access to ad-free Max when you subscribe to select AT&T Unlimited Choice or Plus plans, which start at $60 a month. If you opt for Cricket’s Unlimited Plus 15GB Mobile Hotspot phone plan, which starts at $60 a month, you’ll also be able to get the ad-supported version of Max for free. Finally, you can get two months of Max free with DirectTV Stream or Satellite TV services.\nThe best Netflix deals\nA Netflix subscription grants you access to thousands of movies and TV shows, as well as a limited number of mobile games. Notable shows and movies include Squid Game, Dan Da Dan, Baby Reindeer, The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, Cobra Kai, Stranger Things, The Killer, and Arcane, among countless others.\nThe well-known streaming service currently offers three plans: Standard with ads ($7.99 per month), Standard without ads ($17.99 per month), and Premium ($24.99 per month). The premium tier allows for higher resolution, lets multiple users watch content on four devices at the same time as opposed to just two, and lets you download on six devices at a time as opposed to just two. It’s also the only plan that supports 4K Ultra HD content, as well as spatial audio.\nNetflix isn’t currently offering a discount, but T-Mobile is offering the ad-supported plan for free to those on qualifying Go5G Next and Go5G Plus lines. This deal is also available to those on qualifying Magenta Max lines, or for those who sign up to two or more Go56 and Magenta lines. As mentioned previously, you can also get a year of both Netflix and Max when you purchase one of the following Verizon Home internet plans: a 5G Home Plus, LTE Home Plus, Fios 1 Gig, or the Fios 2 Gig Verizon Home Internet (VHI) plan.\nThe best YouTube TV deals\nYouTube TV grants subscribers access to live sports and a number of major news and entertainment channels, including PBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, NBC, ABC, Fox, CNN, and more. It also comes with unlimited recording for a maximum of six accounts, all for $82.99 per month. You can buy optional add-ons as well, which range between $2 and $65 a month and include access to services like Max, Starz, and NBA League Pass. The service also offers a separate Spanish-only plan.\nNow through March 31st, new subscribers can sign up for the YouTube TV Base Plan for $69.99 ($13 off) a month for the first six months. You’ll also receive a weeklong trial of Max when you sign up.\nThe best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals\nParamount Plus and Showtime provides access to live sports and 24/7 live news with CBS News. It also grants access to the entire Paramount Plus catalog, including shows like Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Yellowstone spinoff 1923, as well as films like Gladiator II and Top Gun: Maverick. You’ll also get access to Showtime’s library, which includes originals like Billions, Dexter: Resurrection, and Yellowjackets, as well as movies like Talk To Me and Past Lives.\nIf you want to subscribe to both Paramount Plus and Showtime, you can sign up for the ad-free Paramount Plus with Showtime package for $12.99 a month. Alternatively, if you’re willing to pay upfront, you can save about $36 over the course of a year when you subscribe to the annual plan for $119.99 per year.\nAlternatively, you can subscribe to Paramount Plus as a standalone service when you pay for Paramount Plus’ ad-supported Essential plan, which costs $7.99 per month. The annual plan, meanwhile, costs $59.99 per year, saving you $36 over the course of 12 months if you’re willing to pay upfront. Just bear in mind this plan offers less live sports than the Paramount Plus with Showtime package, and won’t let you download content for offline viewing.\nIn terms of deals, Walmart Plus subscribers can currently get the Essential plan for free as part of their subscription. College students can also subscribe to the Essential plan for $5.99 ($2 off) a month, while seniors with an AARP membership can get a 10 percent discount on the Essential plan or Paramount Plus with Showtime plan. Lastly, military members can get a 50 percent discount on a year of the Essential or Paramount Plus with Showtime plans.\nThe best Starz deals\nWith Starz, you can stream a variety of shows and movies, including John Wick: Chapter 4, M3GAN, and Asteroid City, as well as originals like Outlander and Sweetpea. The platform only offers a single ad-free plan that runs $10.99 a month, and you can stream on up to four devices at a time and download content for offline viewing. Right now, however, some subscribers can get three months of Starz for $3 a month. Alternatively, you can get six months for $17.99 instead of $45.99.\nThe best Amazon Prime Video deals\nAmazon Prime Video is an on-demand streaming service owned by Amazon. Its library includes a range of movies, some live content, and shows like Fallout, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, The Boys, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and more. You can also watch certain titles in 4K and take advantage of deals on rentals and purchases not included in the subscription. There’s also an option to add extra channels with Prime Video channels, or go ad-free for an additional $2.99 a month.\nAmazon Prime Video is included with an Amazon Prime membership, though you can sign up for the service without a membership for $8.99 a month with ads or $11.98 without. Right now, customers of Metro By T-Mobile’s unlimited plan can also get a free Amazon Prime membership, which provides access to Prime Video and other benefits, for free.","summary":"It being winter and all, there’s a high probability that many of us are spending more time bingeing TV shows and movies indoors than we might otherwise.

And while V-Day might officially be behind us, Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and plenty of other retailers are still discounting a range of tech for Presidents Day, including some of the gadgets and gizmos we often fawn over at The Verge.\nRight now, for instance, the Apple Watch Series 10 is down to its best to date. You can also find discounts on noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s WH-1000XM5, smart home devices like the Mill Food Recycler, versatile USB-C chargers, streaming services, and more.

Apple’s entry-level tablet uses an A14 Bionic chipset and offers a 10.9-inch display that’s roomy enough for almost any task you can carry out on it. Although you might want a higher-end model for 4K editing and heavier workloads, the entry-level iPad is great for almost any other moderate need, including browsing, streaming, and doodling (it’s compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil and the newer USB-C model). It can even handle some light gaming.

Apple’s ultra wideband trackers are our No. 1 pick for iPhone users, as they allow you to track your keys, bag, and other belongings within inches of their location using Apple’s extensive Find My network. They also feature replaceable batteries, carry an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, and offer tracking alerts to help prevent stalking. Hell, you can even now share their location with a handful of airlines, courtesy of a recent iOS 18 update.

The last-gen Air is still a great laptop for most people, especially now that it starts with 16GB of RAM. That gives it enough memory to handle macOS Sequoia’s AI-based Apple Intelligence features, along with enough power for light video, photo, and audio work. It’s also noticeably lighter than the MacBook Pro, yet it still lasts all day thanks to the efficiency of Apple’s M2 chip.\nThe best headphone and earbud deals\nSony’s WH-1000XM4 are available for around $248 ($100 off) at Amazon and Best Buy.
