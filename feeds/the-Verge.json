Amazon vice president Steve Downer says that “consumers will value seeing the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark both on product packaging and while shopping online,” and Best Buy head of enterprise privacy and data protection Michael Dolan says it’s “a positive step forward for consumers.”\nThe launch is a long time coming after initially being announced in 2023. FCC commissioners unanimously voted to approve the labeling program in March, opening a public comment period. Recently, the FCC conditionally approved 11 companies to be Cybersecurity Label Administrators, which will help review applications for the label. Neuberger and FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel are slated to discuss the program at the Consumer Electronics Show on Thursday.\n“Americans buying home alarm systems and baby monitors need to know hackers can’t disable the alarm system remotely or hack in to watch their babies asleep,” Neuberger says. “Companies need to have an incentive to bake security into products, and the US government wants to give American consumers that confidence, and we welcome this voluntary mechanism to assure consumers and companies that products are cyber safe.”","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338168/us-cyber-trust-mark-smart-home-security","isoDate":"2025-01-07T17:30:00.000Z"},{"title":"Technics’ new flagship earbuds have ‘Magnetic Fluid’ drivers","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24337470/technics-eah-az100-wireless-earbuds-ces-2025","pubDate":"2025-01-07T17:30:00.000Z","author":"Quentyn Kennemer","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Someone holding Technics EAH-AZ100 earbuds in case\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mgMXyXI4F9XCTJv-hGSACPEhjp4=/1462x791:6210x3956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73832744/AZ100_lifestyle_silver_6.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Photo: Panasonic</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"KkRGkq\">The Panasonic-owned audio brand Technics makes some of the best wireless earbuds that most people have probably never heard of.

The difference is, unlike ChatGPT and other similar generative AI assistants, EvieAI theoretically won’t be pulling from vast repositories of public data where health and wellness misinformation runs rife. According to Movano CEO John Mastrototaro, it’s been trained on and will be constrained to over 100,000 medical journals written by medical professionals. </p>\n<p id=\"obBq4R\">All the data the LLM has access to comes from accredited sources that have been referred to by a medical advisory board, Mastrototaro says. That includes FDA-approved journals, practices, and procedures. EvieAI is a bounded LLM, which means it will only speak to data from the “post-training” phase after it’s been initially created. In this case, that means medical data. The data is then cross-referenced with organizations like the Mayo Clinic, Harvard, and UCLA. The LLM does this by referencing this outside data before answering and making sure there isn’t a conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"BOKEJS\">The result, according to Movano, is 99 percent accuracy, though we weren’t able to test EvieAI for ourselves before CES.

The Asus Zenbook A14 is a new thin and light productivity machine announced at CES 2025 sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor for a claimed battery life of up to 32 hours and a weight of just 2.18 pounds — just over half a pound lighter than the current <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review\">M3 MacBook Air</a>. The A14’s ultralight magnesium alloy chassis is decked out in Asus’ “Ceraluminum” ceramic coating to keep its weight down and give the laptop a matte, stone-like finish.</p>\n<p id=\"9lCyXh\">Asus is undercutting Apple’s M3 Air in price as well as weight. The Zenbook A14 with a new base-model eight-core Snapdragon X will start at $1,099.99 in gray when it launches in mid-January with 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and a 14-inch OLED display capable of 1920 x 1200 resolution running at 60Hz with 600 nits of peak brightness. Later in March, Asus will launch an even cheaper $899.99 model in beige that’s a little heavier at 2.4 pounds, with a slightly higher-end eight-core Snapdragon X Plus chip but only 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage — exclusively sold at Best Buy.</p>\n<div id=\"ZkLSg8\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:12520591\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"SCdnZt\">The A14 has a 70Wh battery, compared to the smaller 52.6Wh cell in the MacBook Air. And it offers a decent selection of ports, with two USB 4 Type-C for charging / data, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, a 3.5mm combo headphone / mic jack, and a full-size HDMI 2.1 port. The A14 can connect to up to three external monitors with its lid open, compared to the M3 MacBook Air’s two monitors while its lid is closed (though, keep in mind, one of those monitors will have to provide power to the Zenbook over USB-C).</p>\n<p id=\"CVPZPV\">It all sounds pretty compelling on paper, but while <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24319497/windows-on-arm-2024-review-laptops\">Windows on Arm proved its competence in 2024</a> through Snapdragon X’s balance of performance and battery life, there can still be compatibility headaches in some unsupported apps and games. And frankly, while our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24191671/copilot-plus-pcs-laptops-qualcomm-intel-amd-apple\">benchmarks of Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors</a> were competitive in some ways with Apple’s M3 MacBook Air, I’m skeptical a new lower-end version can really hang against it — let alone an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277876/apple-m4-macbook-air-update\">anticipated M4 model</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"QzCTE0\">I had a very brief moment to get my hands on the Zenbook A14 at an early preview event in December, and I can attest to how surprisingly light Asus’ new laptop is.

The Asus Zenbook A14 is a new thin and light productivity machine announced at CES 2025 sporting a Qualcomm Snapdragon X processor for a claimed battery life of up to 32 hours and a weight of just 2.18 pounds — just over half a pound lighter than the current M3 MacBook Air. The A14’s ultralight magnesium alloy chassis is decked out in Asus’ “Ceraluminum” ceramic coating to keep its weight down and give the laptop a matte, stone-like finish.\nAsus is undercutting Apple’s M3 Air in price as well as weight. The Zenbook A14 with a new base-model eight-core Snapdragon X will start at $1,099.99 in gray when it launches in mid-January with 32GB of RAM, 1TB SSD, and a 14-inch OLED display capable of 1920 x 1200 resolution running at 60Hz with 600 nits of peak brightness. Later in March, Asus will launch an even cheaper $899.99 model in beige that’s a little heavier at 2.4 pounds, with a slightly higher-end eight-core Snapdragon X Plus chip but only 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage — exclusively sold at Best Buy.\n\n\nThe A14 has a 70Wh battery, compared to the smaller 52.6Wh cell in the MacBook Air. And it offers a decent selection of ports, with two USB 4 Type-C for charging / data, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, a 3.5mm combo headphone / mic jack, and a full-size HDMI 2.1 port. The A14 can connect to up to three external monitors with its lid open, compared to the M3 MacBook Air’s two monitors while its lid is closed (though, keep in mind, one of those monitors will have to provide power to the Zenbook over USB-C).\nIt all sounds pretty compelling on paper, but while Windows on Arm proved its competence in 2024 through Snapdragon X’s balance of performance and battery life, there can still be compatibility headaches in some unsupported apps and games. And frankly, while our benchmarks of Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors were competitive in some ways with Apple’s M3 MacBook Air, I’m skeptical a new lower-end version can really hang against it — let alone an anticipated M4 model. \nI had a very brief moment to get my hands on the Zenbook A14 at an early preview event in December, and I can attest to how surprisingly light Asus’ new laptop is. You can pick it up from a corner with just two or three fingers with ease, but it doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. The matte finish and sad beige aesthetic may not be to everyone’s liking, and I wager most people might think a MacBook Air’s exposed aluminum feels fancier, but Asus put some of its build quality where it counts. For example, the A14’s hinge can be opened with just one finger, while far too many Windows laptops out there require both hands to pry open their lids.\nYes, I’ll have three fingers of laptop, with a little bit of pepper and some cheese.\n  \nThere have been plenty of claimed “MacBook killers” and past Windows laptops aiming for Apple’s crown as the go-to pick for the average user, but few stack up as the complete packages like those offered by Apple. Maybe pairing a Snapdragon X’s excellent battery life with some nice extras like OLED screens and solid build at affordable-ish prices might bring something special to the table — though we’ll have to see about performance.\nPhotography by Antonio G.

Users can drag and drop “pixels,” or apps that they use frequently, into a couple of main boxes on the home screen so they are more readily available. According to BMW, the company does have plans to offer a BMW app store for the new UX, which could include paid apps for things like special lighting packages, similar to Hyundai’s plans for the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301740/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row-electric-suv-laas\">Ioniq 9</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"EmlETD\">BMW says it’s using edge AI to “learn” from the customer as they drive and offer relevant features based on behavior.
