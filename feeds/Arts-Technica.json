Google claims Loss of Pulse Detection goes further, offering new functionality on a consumer wearable.\nLike the EKG features that became standard a few years back, Loss of Pulse Detection requires regulatory approval. Google was able to get clearance to ship the Pixel Watch 3 with Loss of Pulse Detection in a few European countries, eventually expanding to 14 nations: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. It noted at the time more countries would get access as regulators approved the feature, and the FDA was apparently the first to come through outside of Europe, boosting support to 15 countries.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Ryan Whitwam\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-to-alert-you-if-youre-dying/#comments","content":"\n            But you'll have to wait a bit longer to turn the feature on.\n          ","contentSnippet":"But you'll have to wait a bit longer to turn the feature on.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-to-alert-you-if-youre-dying/","categories":["Google","Tech","fda","google","wearables"],"isoDate":"2025-02-26T21:35:51.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","title":"Single-fiber computer could one day track your health","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/fiber-computer-woven-into-clothing-can-monitor-health/","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Feb 2025 21:15:29 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Imagine heading out for a run on a cold winter day clad in athletic gear with sensors and microelectronics woven into the very fiber to constantly monitor your vital signs, even running the occasional app. MIT scientists have manufactured a single fiber computer embedded with all the components to do just that, according to a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08568-6\">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature.</p>\n<p>“Our bodies broadcast gigabytes of data through the skin every second in the form of heat, sound, biochemicals, electrical potentials, and light, all of which carry information about our activities, emotions, and health,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074586?\">said co-author Yoel Fink</a>, a materials scientist and engineer at MIT. \"Unfortunately, most if not all of it gets absorbed and then lost in the clothes we wear.

Regardless of powertrain, a brand-new Volvo starting at approximately $35,000 was a big deal to me. I might have even suggested online that the EX30 was the most important Volvo ever, full stop. There's no reason why this vehicle shouldn't be a global sales success.\nThen, former-President Joe Biden gave the Volvo a reason why it wouldn't be a sales success: He attached a 100 percent tariff on all-electric vehicles coming from China. With Volvo's parent Geely manufacturing the EX30 in China, the value proposition quickly vanished. Fortunately for Volvo, there is a production facility in Ghent, Belgium, that can pick up the slack for export to the United States. The plant currently builds the EC40 and XC40 Recharge, so adding another battery-electric vehicle shouldn't take too much time.\nWhy do I care? Because the EX30 I was the most excited about wasn't the street-focused standard model but the off-the-beaten-path-but-not-really-off-road Cross Country variant.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Chad Kirchner\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/volvo-added-plenty-of-charm-to-the-ex30-cross-country-ev/#comments","content":"\n            The mods should work as well on potholes as they do on forest roads.\n          ","contentSnippet":"The mods should work as well on potholes as they do on forest roads.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/volvo-added-plenty-of-charm-to-the-ex30-cross-country-ev/","categories":["Cars","First drive","Volvo EX30 Cross Country"],"isoDate":"2025-02-26T15:43:12.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Eric Berger\n        ","title":"Long-time advocate of SLS rocket says it’s time to find an “off-ramp”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/long-time-advocate-of-sls-rocket-says-its-time-to-find-an-off-ramp/","pubDate":"Wed, 26 Feb 2025 14:52:48 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>The lights may be starting to go out for NASA's Space Launch System program.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, one of the Republican space policy leaders most consistently opposed to commercial heavy lift rockets over the last decade—as an alternative to NASA's large SLS rocket—has changed his mind.</p>\n<p>\"We need an off-ramp for reliance on the SLS,\" said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, in written testimony.
