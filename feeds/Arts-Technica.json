In most cases to date, however, those claims were quickly followed by some tuning and optimization of classical algorithms that boosted their performance, making them competitive once again.\nToday, we have a new entry into the claims department—or rather a new claim by an old entry. D-Wave is a company that makes quantum annealers, specialized hardware that is most effective when applied to a class of optimization problems. The new work shows that the hardware can track the behavior of a quantum system called an Ising model far more efficiently than any of the current state-of-the-art classical algorithms.\nKnowing what will likely come next, however, the team behind the work writes, \"We hope and expect that our results will inspire novel numerical techniques for quantum simulation.\"\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          John Timmer\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/d-wave-quantum-annealers-solve-problems-classical-algorithms-struggle-with/#comments","content":"\n            The latest claim of a clear quantum supremacy solves a useful problem.\n          ","contentSnippet":"The latest claim of a clear quantum supremacy solves a useful problem.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/d-wave-quantum-annealers-solve-problems-classical-algorithms-struggle-with/","categories":["Science","algorithm","Computer science","D-Wave","ising model","Physics","quantum annealing","quantum computing","quantum mechanics"],"isoDate":"2025-03-12T20:36:38.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Benj Edwards\n        ","title":"Google’s new robot AI can fold delicate origami, close zipper bags without damage","link":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/googles-origami-folding-ai-brain-may-power-new-wave-of-humanoid-robots/","pubDate":"Wed, 12 Mar 2025 19:38:57 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>On Wednesday, Google DeepMind <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics-brings-ai-into-the-physical-world/\">announced</a> two new AI models designed to control robots: Gemini Robotics and Gemini Robotics-ER.
