But, things changed in late 2021 with the emergence of omicron, which still reigns supreme today. According to the data, an infection with omicron provided an initial protection of nearly 80 percent between the first three to six months after infection, but that protection rapidly declined. Between nine months and a year, protection fell to around 27.5 percent, then dropped to a negligible 5 percent after a year.\nChemaitelly et al., Nature, 2025\n      \nThe results of infection-derived protection were similar regardless of whether people were vaccinated or unvaccinated, a sub analysis found. The study did not evaluate vaccine efficacy.

It's the same strain that killed a Louisiana resident in early January and sent a Canadian teenager to intensive care in early November.\nThe new Nevada dairy infections were first detected through milk testing conducted on January 31, according to an update Wednesday by the US Department of Agriculture. Whole genome sequencing confirmed the finding of H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype D1.1. To this point, all other dairy herds affected by the outbreak have been infected with H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, genotype B3.13.\nTo date, 957 herds across 16 states have been infected with H5N1 since the outbreak began last March. That tally includes four new herds from Nevada.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Beth Mole\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/strain-of-h5n1-bird-flu-that-killed-louisiana-resident-found-in-nevada-dairies/#comments","content":"\n            The finding suggests a new spillover event, further dashing hopes of containment.\n          ","contentSnippet":"The finding suggests a new spillover event, further dashing hopes of containment.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/strain-of-h5n1-bird-flu-that-killed-louisiana-resident-found-in-nevada-dairies/","categories":["Health","bird flu","cows","dairy","H5N1","Infectious disease","nevada","outbreak","USDA"],"isoDate":"2025-02-05T22:52:47.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","title":"DOJ agrees to temporarily block DOGE from Treasury records","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/judge-suggests-temporary-order-blocking-doge-from-treasury-records/","pubDate":"Wed, 05 Feb 2025 22:31:58 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Late Wednesday, a joint motion was filed with a proposed <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DOGE-Proposed-Order-2-5-25.pdf\">order</a>, where the DOJ and plaintiffs suing agreed that the Treasury Department \"will not provide access to any payment record or payment system of records maintained by or within the Bureau of the Fiscal Service\" to anyone connected with DOGE, except \"special government employees\" in the Treasury Department, Tom Krause and Marko Elez.
