Signs have gone up (and back down), icons are changing, and an old plan is new.\nHow’d we get here?\nOn April 4th, 2022, we learned that Musk had purchased enough shares of Twitter to become its largest individual shareholder. Eventually, he followed up with an unsolicited offer to buy 100 percent of Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each, or about $44 billion.  Twitter accepted Musk’s offer, but then things got weird because he tried to cancel the deal.\nThere was a lot of back-and-forth about bots and text messages, but in the end, Musk settled on buying the company rather than facing a deposition or Chancery Court trial and eventually strode into Twitter HQ carrying a sink.\nSince then, there have been layoffs, more layoffs, and even more layoffs — plus drama over Substack, unpaid bills, and blue checkmarks. With ad revenue still down from previous years, Elon finally abdicated the role of CEO in May 2023, installing longtime NBCUniversal ad executive Linda Yaccarino.\nRead on for the latest updates about what’s going on inside Twitter right now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTrump’s January 6th Twitter lawsuit settled for ‘about $10 million’\n\t\t\t\nTrump drops his Twitter lawsuit appeal.\n\t\t\t\nX says its payments service will finally launch this year\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk email to X staff: ‘we’re barely breaking even’\n\t\t\t\nDozens of subreddits are banning links to X\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk is being sued by the feds over the way he bought Twitter\n\t\t\t\nHow Elon Musk’s xAI is quietly taking over X\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk says X’s algorithm pushes “too much negativity.”\n\t\t\t\nX’s new ‘Aurora’ image generator is gone.\n\t\t\t\nX gives Grok a new photorealistic AI image generator\n\t\t\t\nWho actually owns your social media accounts?

She is appealing the ruling. However, a judge has determined that she and Balwani owe the victims of their fraud $452 million.\nOn May 30th, Holmes reported to prison to begin serving her sentence.\nTheranos was once valued as high as $9 billion, and Holmes was a darling of Silicon Valley, sporting black turtlenecks that prompted comparisons to Steve Jobs.\nThat changed after John Carreyrou’s exposé was published in The Wall Street Journal. In that article, Carreyrou wrote that Theranos was using its own device for only a handful of tests and that other employees were concerned that the device wasn’t accurate.\nThen it came out that Theranos’ labs weren’t up to par, and its partnerships with Safeway and Walgreens fell apart. Also, Theranos junked two years’ worth of test results. Eventually, Holmes was banned from operating labs, and Theranos dissolved in 2018.\nElizabeth Holmes’ bizarre PR campaign continues\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes’ prison sentence reduced by two years.\n\t\t\t\nTheranos co-founder Elizabeth Holmes has reported to prison.\n\t\t\t\nTheranos founder Elizabeth Holmes must report to prison on May 30th.\n\t\t\t\nJudge denies Elizabeth Holmes’ latest attempt to stay out of jail.\n\t\t\t\nThe judge who sentenced Elizabeth Holmes explains the reasoning behind his decision.\n\t\t\t\nFormer Theranos executive Sunny Balwani is sentenced to almost 13 years in prison\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes has been sentenced to over 11 years in prison\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes’s bid for a retrial has been denied.\n\t\t\t\nIs Elizabeth Holmes’ guilty verdict a wake-up call for startups?\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes’ verdict won’t change Silicon Valley\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes found guilty of defrauding investors\n\t\t\t\nThe story of Elizabeth Holmes now belongs to the jury\n\t\t\t\nThe Holmes trial is about money\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes was always in control\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes smiles on the stand as her trial nears an end\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes admits that she was CEO of Theranos, the company she founded\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes says Theranos’ former president abused her\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes admitted to a key part of the case against her\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes tells the jury that at least some of Theranos was real\n\t\t\t\nIn her Theranos fraud case, Elizabeth Holmes is speaking for herself\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes will take your $1.2 million but not your phone calls\n\t\t\t\nElizabeth Holmes hired a bunch of experts so she could ignore them\n\t\t\t\nHappy Halloween!
