From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel.&nbsp;<em>— Emma Roth, news writer</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One of the first things I did when I got my own place was purchase a food chopper.

Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/EPICKA-Universal-Travel-Adapter-Power/dp/B078S3M2NX/\">this one from Epicka</a>&nbsp;is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.</p>\n\n<p>The only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs.

It’s probably unnecessary if you’re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you’re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it’s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they’re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09PGZHCXR/\">Anker combination extension cord / power strip</a>. It’s not a full power strip —&nbsp;just a cube with a few sockets along with USB and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I’ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people’s devices.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re traveling overseas, don’t forget to purchase a different plug type. — <em>Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor</em></p>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"bQmmEy\">Other gadgets</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p>Most of the things I own are, frankly,&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;unreliable enough to be annoying.

Just in case you’d like to check them out.\nKitchen help\nAfter realizing we’re not a family who likes to get their hands dirty while cooking (we leave that part to mixers and blenders), an automatic soap dispenser has become one of the most used devices in our kitchen. We opted for a cheap $25 option from Amazon that lets you adjust how much foaming soap is dispensed and lasts for a couple of months between charges, but companies like Simplehuman sell pricier $80 versions wrapped in brushed metal or other fancy finishes that could better match your decor. We find we use less soap now that it’s always perfectly portioned out, and buying refills in bulk is much cheaper. There’s now one in every bathroom in our home. — Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nFor the past few years, the Instant Pot has been a staple in my kitchen. From making rice to slow-cooking stews and even frying up chicken, it can do just about anything. The best part is that the Instant Pot can cook most recipes in a fraction of the time it would take in the oven or on the stove. Rice, for example, takes just six minutes to cook (not counting the amount of time it takes to build pressure), and there’s no fussing with covering the pot or adjusting the heat. Sometimes, it’s just easier — and much less stressful — to let the Instant Pot take the wheel. — Emma Roth, news writer\nOne of the first things I did when I got my own place was purchase a food chopper. Perhaps puritan chefs will disagree with my methods, but this saves me so much time. I like to make tikka masala, which requires dicing ginger. If you’ve ever tried to dice ginger, you know that a food chopper would come in handy. This one did break recently, so I’ll probably replace it with a fancier one. — Kylie Robison, senior AI reporter\nInfant & child care\nThe Yogasleep Hushh is a small, portable white noise machine. That’s it, and that’s why it’s great.\nIt’s not a smart device and doesn’t require any sort of subscription. It has physical buttons. It has three different white noise options. It can run on battery for up to 24 hours, and you can charge it with a USB-C cable. It even comes with a ring to attach it to things.\nMy wife and I turn on the Hushh every time we put our baby down to sleep. If you’re looking for a simple white noise machine that just works, this is the one to buy. – Jay Peters, news editor\nWhen screen time is over, there’s no building toy, not even Lego, that holds my kid’s attention better than GraviTrax. It lets you build complicated marble runs using myriad components, including ramps, risers, bridges, switches, and launchers — and that’s just the starter set. There are several expansions that add motorized components that can keep marbles rolling indefinitely if assembled correctly, and it’s one of those toys that adults will enjoy just as much as kids do. For younger kids, there’s also now a GraviTrax Junior line with simpler components and larger marbles. – Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter, news\nA musical penguin toy that cycles through surprisingly boppy remixes. It flaps its wings with high-contrast black-and-white spots that will mesmerize your baby. – Helen Havlak, publisher\nThe Snoo is a smart bassinet that plays white noise and rocks your baby, ramping up the intensity if your baby keeps crying. I have heard from friends that it does not work for every baby, but when it works, it really works — and you have truly magical moments when it successfully puts your baby to sleep. You can control the intensity manually and get nice sleep logs in their proprietary app — though Snoo’s parent company, Happiest Baby, has come under fire for introducing a new subscription fee of $19.99 / month for the main app functionality after nine months. While infuriating, I was so desperate for sleep, I would still have bought a Snoo. Also, look out for return policies; some parents prefer to buy their Snoos from Amazon to avoid Happiest Baby’s steep $199 restocking fee. – Helen Havlak, publisher\nGarden gadgets\nFungus gnats love overwatered soil, so once you’ve gotten rid of them, you’ve got to be careful and diligent about your watering schedule. For that, I got myself a Gouevn soil moisture meter to teach myself how to properly water my plants. I’ve properly vanquished my fungus gnat issue, but with these two tools, I’m always prepared in case there’s ever another infestation. – Victoria Song, senior reviewer\nOne day, I received a surprise package in the mail from my mom, and it included these Velcro garden ties. I’d never even seen these before, so I decided to try them with my orchid. I found that they’re a lot softer than the plastic ties I used previously, and they do a pretty good job at supporting my plants, both indoor and outdoor. You can simply cut the Velcro ties to size, wrap them around your plant, and the tie will stick to itself. They’re reusable, too! — Emma Roth, news writer\nCharging gadgets\nIn my youth, I forgot to pack plug adapters for international trips one too many times. Buying them once you’ve landed in another country isn’t always easy, either. And if you’re like me, your relatives in rural Korea don’t always have more than one plug for your American devices — in which case, you’ll have to share with your six other cousins. Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter.\nBasically, it’s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it’s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you’ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it’s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage.\nThe only caveat is that, although it says “universal,” it’s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That’ll get you by in most countries, but it’s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India.

Multiple <em>Verge</em> staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes.

While the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day or even Amazon’s October event (and the frequency of new deals coming to the surface has slowed down), you can still find steep savings on security cameras, headphones, smartwatches, the best football video game released in the past year, and loads of other tech.\nWe’ve dug into all the deals and discounts available so far, the best of which you’ll find below. By and large, most of the deals will last until the end of the event. And, while having a Prime subscription means your packages will certainly arrive more quickly, you don’t necessarily need to be a member to get in on these tried-and-tested Verge favorites (only in rare cases are deals exclusive to Prime members, and we’ll note when that’s the case). We’ll also be keeping an eye on deals at competing retailers, including Best Buy, Walmart, and Target.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured deals\nRobot vacuum deals\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nPortable charger and cable deals\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nSmart home deals\nTablet and e-reader deals\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nOther Verge favorites\n\nFeatured deals\nRobot vacuum deals\nThe Dreame L20 Ultra is on sale for a new low of $549.99 ($450 off) at Amazon. It lacks the self-retracting arms found on the newer, more powerful X40, but otherwise it’s a great cleaning machine. The dual mop pads can still extend to clean baseboard and corners, while its 7,000Pa of suction power does a good job of sucking up unwanted dirt and debris. The robovac is also capable of emptying its own dust bin and water tanks (as well as refilling them), in addition to washing and drying its own mop pads.\nVerge smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy recommends the Roborock Q5 Pro for those who want a budget-friendly robot vacuum that’s skilled in the arcane art of sucking up pet hair. Fortunately, the Q5 Pro Plus model is on sale at Amazon with its auto-empty bin for just $299.99 ($400 off) — a $70 upcharge on the standard Q50 Pro that’s well worth it if your space has a lot of fur to sweep up.\nIf you’re looking for an even cheaper robot vacuum, you can buy the SwitchBot K10 Plus with a self-emptying dock for a new low of $175.99 at Amazon, down from $399.99. The small, quiet robovac only offers 2,500Pa suction, but that’s still powerful enough to suck up dirt from most carpets. It also offers a lidar-based mapping system, and while it lacks bells and whistles like obstacle avoidance, it at least lets you set digital keep-out zones. Plus, as an added bonus, you can use it with disposable mopping pads.\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nThe Beats Studio Pro are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $179.95 ($170 off), which remains one of the best prices we’ve seen. Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C. Plus, unlike most noise-canceling headphones, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. Read our review.\nIf you prefer a pair of noise-canceling earbuds that support native software features on both iOS and Android, the Beats Studio Buds Plus are available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $130 ($40 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Yes, their lack of wireless charging and in-ear detection stings a bit at their typical list price, but their see-through design is slick enough that the shortcomings are (almost) forgivable. Read our review.\nIf you’re not dead set on noise cancellation but would still like a pair of Apple earbuds, the recently released AirPods 4 are matching their all-time low of $99.99 ($30 off) at Amazon and Walmart right now. They’re a substantial upgrade over the prior model when it comes to call clarity and sound, and they offer the same seamless integration with macOS, iOS, and tvOS as the rest of Apple’s earbuds. Read our review.\nThe Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e — aka, the best-sounding wireless headphones you can buy — are available at Amazon starting at $295.60 (about $103 off), or from Bower & Wilkins or Best Buy for $318.99 ($80 off). The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5. Read our review.\nAnker’s Soundcore Sport X20 earbuds are on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $63.99 ($16 off), matching their second-best price to date. The fitness-friendly buds are a lot like the Sport X10 — which were once our favorite budget earbuds for the gym — only they offer longer battery life, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and multipoint support. They also supposedly offer better noise cancellation and continue to sport an adjustable ear hook, which is a boon if you’re someone who struggles with keeping traditional earbuds in during intense gym sessions.\nPortable charger and cable deals\nPower banks with built-in USB-C cables are the hot thing right now. As it turns out, having a battery pack that can charge your device in a jiffy and double as a lanyard is pretty great. Luckily, you can snag one of the most affordable 20,000mAh models out there, Anker’s 30W Zolo power bank, for $24.61 (about $11 off) at Amazon. While it’s not powerful enough to quickly charge a Steam Deck that’s running games, it’ll do just fine for charging it (as well as other USB-C devices) while they sleep.\nIf you’re someone who owns (or, someday, envisions owning) USB-C gadgets that draw a lot of power, it’s wise to buy cables with high wattage passthrough, just so you’re ready for the future. Anker’s six-foot 240W USB-C cable is a great candidate, especially since it’s discounted to $16.99 ($8 off) at Amazon.\nUgreen’s Uno lineup of charging accessories aims to be more personable. To that end, its 6.6-foot 1ooW USB-C cable — which is currently discounted to $10.39 ($2.61 off) at Amazon — has expressive, Tamagotchi-like eyes. The reason? There’s no reason — it’s just cute, okay?\nIf you’re not ready to pony up for a Qi2 charger, Ugreen’s Magnetic Wireless Charging Station has fallen to an all-time low of $21.99 ($14 off) at Amazon. Unlike the newer Qi2 offerings that provide 15W charging speeds, Ugreen’s charger can only supply 7.5W of power to MagSafe-compatible devices, or 5W to a pair of wireless earbuds or any Qi-ready device if you’re using the integrated charging stand located on the bottom.\nIf you need a cheap way to charge your gadgets, Anker’s 30W Nano Charger is matching its all-time low of $12.99 ($3 off) in select colors at Amazon and Anker’s online storefront (with code WS7DV29VBNV2). The single-port USB-C offering doesn’t include a charging cable; however, it does come in a few fun colors and sports a set of folding prongs that allow you to stow it just about anywhere.\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nJBL’s Charge 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in multiple colors starting at $119.95 ($60 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker since July. We’re not huge fans of the oversized JBL logo, but the powerful Bluetooth speaker hits all the right marks when it comes to functionality and performance, offering an impressive 20 hours of battery life and a built-in USB-A port that lets you top off your phone while listening to music.\nDespite the fact the Sonos app has been a bit of a debacle as of late, I have few qualms about recommending the Sonos Era 100 for around $199 ($50 off), its current price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront. It’s a great smart speaker with stereo sound, privacy-conscious microphone controls, and support for both Bluetooth and line-in connections. It can also connect to Spotify and every other music service you can think of and supports AirPlay 2, letting you stream content from Apple devices. Read our review.\nAmazon’s latest Echo Dot is down to $39.99 ($10 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Kohl’s. The tiny, orb-shaped smart speaker features onboard microphones and produces good sound for its size, making it a solid option for listening to music, issuing smart home commands, checking the weather, and making other various Alexa requests. It also includes a built-in temperature sensor, which can tell you the temperature in the room and trigger various Alexa Routines, if necessary. Read our review.\nSony’s SRS-XB100 speaker is available at Amazon and Best Buy for around $48 ($12 off) or at Target for $39.99 if you’re a member of the retailer’s free loyalty program. Despite the fact it’s tiny, the Bluetooth speaker delivers crisp, clear sound along with up to 16 hours of continuous battery life. It also sports IP67 dust and water resistance, so you can take it hiking or to the pool without worrying. Read our review.\nSmart home deals\nThe newer Eero Max 7 routers are also down to some of their best prices to date, with Amazon and Eero selling a single router, which can cover 2,500 square feet, for $479.99 ($120 off). You can also buy two for $919.99 ($230 off) or three for $1,359.99 ($340 off). The mesh routers support Wi-Fi 7 and feature a pair of 10GB ethernet ports, along with two 2.5GB ethernet ports. They also support Matter as well as Zigbee, and can act as a Thread border router.\nYou can buy the Eve Energy Smart Plug and Power Meter at Amazon for $29.95 ($10 off), an all-time low. Like other smart plugs, Eve’s handy device can turn traditional indoor gadgets like lamps and fans into smart devices; it’s also capable of monitoring your energy use and works with all the major smart home platforms (Amazon Alexa, Google Home, etc.) thanks to its support for the newer Matter standard.\nRing’s latest Indoor Cam is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and The Home Depot for $39.99 ($20 off), matching its second-best price to date. The 1080p security camera boasts all the same features as the prior model — including two-way talk, color night vision, and a built-in siren — only it’s equipped with a redesigned mount that makes it easier to adjust. That said, you’ll need a Ring Protect Plan ($4.99 a month / $49.99 a year) to share or view video recordings.\nYou can grab a four-pack of Meross Smart Plug Minis on sale at Amazon for an all-time low of $28.99 ($15 off) when you clip the on-page coupon. That brings the handy, hubless smart plugs down to just over $7 a pop, allowing you to control a range of traditional devices via Apple Home, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa without breaking the bank.\nWant a compact smart display for your nightstand? Amazon’s latest Echo Show 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo for $69.99 ($20 off), which is a pretty typical discount. The Alexa-enabled smart display is Amazon’s smallest at 5.5 inches, though it’s still plenty big enough for managing smart home devices and controlling music playback. It also has a 2-megapixel camera (with an integrated privacy shutter), just in case you want to use it for more than a smart alarm clock.\nThe Blink Wired Floodlight Camera is on sale for $69.99 ($20 off) at Amazon and The Home Depot, which is $20 shy of its all-time low and the best price we’ve seen since the holidays. The inexpensive, Alexa-compatible outdoor security camera offers decent 1080p video, sports a 105dB siren, and provides 2,600 lumens of brightness via two onboard floodlights. You can also mount it horizontally or vertically, and the camera provides local recording — assuming you opt for the optional Sync Module 2 and a USB stick. \nAmazon’s Smart Thermostat has returned to $61.99 ($18 off) at Amazon and Kohl’s, which has sort of become its base sale price in recent months. The modern, easy-to-use thermostat allows for easy control of your HVAC even while you’re not home and supports Alexa “hunches” to try and predict what changes you need based on your habits, which could help you save on your monthly bill. Read our review.\nAmazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor is on sale for $54.99 ($15 off) at Amazon, which is $10 shy of its best price yet. Not only does the budget-friendly gadget let you know when your air quality is poor, it can also help improve it by automatically turning on Alexa-enabled devices — including smart thermostats and air purifiers — via Alexa Hunches.  Read our original review.\nTablet and e-reader deals\nAmazon’s ad-supported Fire HD 10 tablet is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy right now with 32GB of storage starting at $94.99 ($45 off), or about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. The 2023 model sports USB-C charging, a 10.1-inch, 1080p display, and 3GB of RAM, which is plenty if all you’re doing is streaming or browsing. Just be aware that, like all of Amazon’s budget-minded tablets, it’s really focused on serving up Amazon content at every turn.\nIf you prefer a big-screen, note-taking alternative to the Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Colorsoft, the 2024 Kindle Scribe is matching its all-time low of $324.99 ($75 off) at Amazon and Best Buy with 32GB of storage. It remains the biggest Kindle available thanks to its 10.2-inch 300 ppi display, which features a textured cover that makes it feel more akin to writing on paper. The latest model offers a host of new writing features, too, including a tool that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Read our review.\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nAmazon and Walmart are both selling the Garmin Venu Sq 2 starting at around $189 ($60 off), which matches its second-best price to date. Although not originally priced as such, it’s considered an entry-level fitness watch for Garmin fans. It’s pretty stylish, overall, and can last just as long and do just as much as a Fitbit (if not more). We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. Read our full review.\nOther Verge favorites\nThe Blue Yeti microphone is on sale at Amazon in a myriad of colors starting at $89.99 ($40 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.\nOne of our go-to gift guide picks, the Instant Pot Duo Plus, is currently available for an all-time low of $89.95 ($40 off) at Amazon. Multiple Verge staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes. That’s in addition to the ability to cook rice, steam veggies, and sauté, among other actions.\nGovee may be best known for its ambient TV backlighting, but it also makes lighting products to illuminate your entire living space in shades of RGB. One of its most stunning lights, the Smart Table Lamp 2, is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at Amazon. It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better.\nHaving access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the LifeStraw Peak is worth picking up at Amazon for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off). It’s essentially a thick straw outfitted with a filter that’s capable of removing 99.9 percent of bacteria, parasites, and microplastics from the water you’re drinking.\nCagiwiru’s Cordless Air Blower / Duster is down to an all-time low of $18.04 ($7 off) at Amazon (at checkout). It might not be as powerful as a can of compressed air, but it’s close, and it’s much more versatile with its swappable tips, built-in light, and ability to recharge via USB-C.\nThe AeroPress Go is nearly matching its best price to date at Amazon, where you can pick it up for $31.95 ($18 off). It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst Verge staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.\nPet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the ChomChom Roller, especially since it’s currently on sale at Amazon for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair.\nWe like Hoto’s svelte toolkits for a couple of reasons. They strike a minimalistic look, for one thing, and they incorporate at least one power tool. The company’s Drill Tool Set — which is on sale at Amazon for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.\nWildfire season might be a ways off, but if you’d like to get ahead, you can pick up Coway’s Airmega AP-1512HH Mighty from Amazon and Coway for $165 ($75 off), which nearly matches its second-best price to date. The compact HEPA air purifier features a four-stage filtration system, and though we don’t do a ton of dedicated air purifier testing here at The Verge, we can personally attest to the effectiveness of this midrange model for smaller rooms.\nUpdate, March 29th: Updated to reflect current pricing/availability and several new deals, including discounts on SwitchBot’s Smart Switch Button Pusher and the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.","summary":"Just as flower buds are beginning to bloom to mark the seasonal shift toward warmer months, Amazon is hosting its first big sale event of 2025.
