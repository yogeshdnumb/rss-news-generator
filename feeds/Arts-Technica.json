For example, a technology called dual-rail qubits takes its value from which of two linked resonators holds a photon. But there are many other quantum objects that have access to far more than two states—think of something like all the possible energy states an electron could occupy when orbiting an atom. We can use things like this as qubits by only relying on the lowest two energy levels. But there's nothing stopping us from using more than two.\nIn Wednesday's issue of Nature, researchers describe creating qudits, the generic term for systems that hold quantum information—it's short for quantum digits. Using a system that can be in three or four possible states (qutrits and ququarts, respectively), they demonstrate the first error correction of higher-order quantum memory.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n                    John Timmer\n                ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/beyond-qubits-meet-the-qutrit-and-ququart/#comments","content":"\n                        It's relatively easy to store multiple quantum values in one piece of hardware.\n                    ","contentSnippet":"It's relatively easy to store multiple quantum values in one piece of hardware.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/beyond-qubits-meet-the-qutrit-and-ququart/","categories":["Science","Computer science","Physics","quantum computing","quantum mechanics","qubits","quirts","ququarts"],"isoDate":"2025-05-14T20:29:12.000Z"},{"creator":"\n                    Jennifer Ouellette\n                ","title":"Krypto steals the show (again) in Superman trailer","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/05/krypto-steals-the-show-again-in-superman-trailer/","pubDate":"Wed, 14 May 2025 20:12:04 +0000","content:encoded":"\n                            <div class=\"ars-video\"><div class=\"relative\" allow=\"fullscreen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ox8ZLF6cGM0?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent\"></div><div class=\"caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300\">\n    <div class=\"caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0\"></div>\n    <div class=\"caption-content\">\n      David Corenswet stars as Clark Kent in director James Gunn's <em>Superman</em>.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>We're about to enter a new era for DC Studios with the July release of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(2025_film)\"><em>Superman</em></a>, writer/director James Gunn's fresh take on one of the most iconic superheroes.
