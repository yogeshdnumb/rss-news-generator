Thirteen years later, Whitehead is still cancer-free.\nThe modified cells, called CAR-T cells, are a form of immunotherapy, where doctors change parts of the immune system into cancer-attacking instruments. About five years after Whitehead’s treatment, the first CAR-T drugs were approved by the FDA and were heralded, along with immunotherapy more broadly, as one of the most promising modern cancer treatments. Today, there are seven FDA-approved CAR-T therapies, including the one used to treat Whitehead.\nSince then, however, studies have linked CAR-T to fatal complications due to treatment toxicity, and the treatment has had a harder time addressing certain types of cancers, particularly solid tumors affecting the breast and pancreas, although some small clinical trials have been starting to show positive results for solid cancers. “After a decade, a decade and a half, we arrive at the point that there are patients who answer, most of the patients still do not answer,” said George Calin, a researcher at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Claudia López Lloreda, Undark Magazine\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-new-era-in-cancer-therapies-is-at-hand/#comments","content":"\n            New therapeutic strategies build on the success of immunotherapy.\n          ","contentSnippet":"New therapeutic strategies build on the success of immunotherapy.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/05/a-new-era-in-cancer-therapies-is-at-hand/","categories":["Health","cancer","immunotherapy","syndication"],"isoDate":"2025-05-12T13:54:34.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Kevin Purdy\n        ","title":"The tinkerers who opened up a fancy coffee maker to AI brewing","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/the-tinkerers-who-opened-up-a-fancy-coffee-maker-to-ai-brewing/","pubDate":"Mon, 12 May 2025 11:00:49 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p class=\"p1\">It’s taken a while, but I’ve finally found the thing I want generative AI to do for me: program a damn fine cup of coffee.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Program, that is, but not make—that’s the job of the <a href=\"https://fellowproducts.com/products/aiden-precision-coffee-maker\">Fellow Aiden</a>, a coffee maker that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/fellow-aiden-precision-coffee-maker/\">crafts automated, precision pour-overs</a> in a countertop-ready cube.
