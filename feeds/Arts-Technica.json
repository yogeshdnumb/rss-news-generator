Declaring a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Trump's orders seemed bent on \"downplaying\" the potential economic impact on Americans, AP News reported.\nBut very quickly, the trade policy sparked inflation fears, with industry associations representing major US firms from many sectors warning of potentially derailed supply chains and spiked consumer costs of cars, groceries, consumer technology, and more. Perhaps the biggest pain will be felt by car buyers already frustrated by high prices if car prices go up by $3,000, as Bloomberg reported.
