Plug in mousepad, snap a magnetic “Charging Coin” into the base of your mouse, then put mouse on mousepad to continuously charge.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bad news: It’s only $20 cheaper, yet it feels like Logitech made its mousepad more than $20 cheaper to hit that goal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The mousepad does come with improvements. Logitech boasts it has a 15 percent wider charging area and is thinner at just 3.5mm, and that’s what I see with my review unit. Now, as long as the entirety of my G502 Lightspeed mouse is resting within any corner of the mousepad, the charging indicator lights up, which wasn’t quite true of the original.

And do you leave your mouse all the way at the corners of your mousepad? Again, I’ve spent over three years charging this mouse on the old mousepad without even thinking about it.

First, while Logitech has ditched the old micro-USB cable, we’re <em>not</em> getting USB-C.

Now, my mouse requires two full-size USB ports instead of one because I still have to leave the mouse’s dongle plugged into my PC, too. I can’t leave the dongle stowed in the mouse for grab-and-go travel, and I can’t leave it in my laptop and switch between laptop and desktop anymore by turning the mouse on and off and yanking the Powerplay’s plug.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also no more programmable RGB light inside the Logitech G logo.

But in recent years, several companies have demonstrated that laptops can be designed so that users can upgrade and easily swap out parts as needed.</p>\n\n<p>Innovative companies like Framework have been producing laptops that don&rsquo;t need to be entirely replaced every few years, and with more success than other companies previously following similar pursuits. In 2021, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/22313742/alienware-area-51m-lawsuit-gpu-upgrade-arbitration-settlement\">Dell was sued</a> over its Alienware laptop that promised GPU upgrades, while Intel has abandoned a couple of modular hardware products, including its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18277596/intel-abandons-compute-cards-pc\">Compute Cards</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For now, it&rsquo;s primarily Framework leading the charge, but its success has inspired competitors like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/6/23884108/lenovo-consumer-repair-pcs-serviceability-framework\">Lenovo</a> to follow suit. As more companies dedicate R&amp;D to the cause, Framework may one day no longer be the only brand associated with modular devices.</p>\n\n<p>You can stay on top of all the latest upgradable and easily repairable device news and developments right here.</p>\n<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/614713/framework-says-its-laptops-shouldnt\">Framework says its

devices with a focus on upgradability and repairability that can extend their longevity, instead of just making them easier to recycle after a few years of use.\nAt one time, nearly every laptop maker was caught up in a race to create ultrathin designs, resulting in hardware that was difficult to upgrade and expensive to repair. But in recent years, several companies have demonstrated that laptops can be designed so that users can upgrade and easily swap out parts as needed.\nInnovative companies like Framework have been producing laptops that don’t need to be entirely replaced every few years, and with more success than other companies previously following similar pursuits. In 2021, Dell was sued over its Alienware laptop that promised GPU upgrades, while Intel has abandoned a couple of modular hardware products, including its Compute Cards.\nFor now, it’s primarily Framework leading the charge, but its success has inspired competitors like Lenovo to follow suit.

The device began shipping in February 2022, starting at $399.\nWith an unprecedented degree of support from Valve and the help of the gaming community, it progressed from being a “glorious mess” in our initial review to becoming one of The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2022 and something other companies couldn’t really match. More than two years after the Steam Deck launched, the landscape is very different now that new competition has arrived in the form of Windows-powered handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and Ayaneo’s assorted decks.\nNow Valve’s new revision of the Steam Deck adds an OLED screen along with tons of other improvements that Sean Hollister says make it “everything the original should have been.”\n\nWe’ve been keeping a close eye on the Steam Deck and rivals, and you can read all of our coverage here.\nLenovo Legion Go S review: feels good, plays bad\n\t\t\t\nDamn, Polygon

change the makeup of the App Store.
