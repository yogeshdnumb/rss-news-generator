To figure out the reasons behind this, researchers at Cambridge University investigated potential obesity genes in Labrador retrievers’ DNA.\nIt turned out increased obesity risk in Labradors was linked to the same genes and mechanisms that cause obesity in humans. These gene variants were more common in purpose-bred dogs we carefully selected, generation after generation, to maximize the results of the demanding training programs service animals must go through.\nWe thought we were picking the smartest Labradors to become guide dogs. But we might have been picking the ones that just wanted the snacks given as rewards the most.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jacek Krywko\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/have-we-accidentally-bred-some-dogs-for-obesity/#comments","content":"\n            Selecting trainable dogs may have gotten us dogs that would do anything for a treat.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Selecting trainable dogs may have gotten us dogs that would do anything for a treat.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/have-we-accidentally-bred-some-dogs-for-obesity/","categories":["Science","behavior","Biology","Dogs","Genetics","Labrador retriever"],"isoDate":"2025-03-13T18:16:46.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ryan Whitwam\n        ","title":"Google’s Gemini AI can now see your search history","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/googles-gemini-ai-can-now-see-your-search-history/","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Mar 2025 16:28:43 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Google is continuing its quest to get more people to use Gemini, and it's doing that by giving away even more AI computing.
