Meta launched Threads on iOS, Android, and the web on July 5th — a little bit ahead of schedule.\nTwo days in, Mark Zuckerberg said Threads has registered over 70 million accounts, and it’s still growing.\nIn an interview about Threads with The Verge, Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri explains why the platform wants to take on Twitter. “Obviously, Twitter pioneered the space,” Mosseri says. “And there are a lot of good offerings out there for public conversations. But just given everything that was going on, we thought there was an opportunity to build something that was open and something that was good for the community that was already using Instagram.”\n\n\n

months, with a March report from Platformer revealing the company was “exploring a standalone decentralized social network for sharing text updates.” In June, Alex Heath leaked the details of a companywide meeting where the app was shown off and shared the first glimpse at Threads.\nThreads is “Instagram’s text-based conversation app” where “communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow.” The app is closely tied to Instagram, meaning you’ll get to use the same username across both apps as well as quickly follow all of the accounts you’ve been following on Instagram.\nThreads gives the Oscars a dedicated tab — whether you care about the awards or not.\n\t\t\t\nThreads now lets you share your custom

They’re meant for people who want a mobile multi-monitor setup that doesn’t require a secondary device to plug in or keep charged. The 2nd Display is like attaching an 8-inch iPad Mini to your laptop, with a vertical orientation that could be great for social feeds and communication apps like Slack or Microsoft Teams. It has a 1920 x 1200 resolution 60Hz panel, which is plenty of resolution for a small screen.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_2025_laptop_preview_ADiBenedetto_0001.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_2025_laptop_preview_ADiBenedetto_0018.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_2025_laptop_preview_ADiBenedetto_0011.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Dual Screen Concept takes the ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 and turns it into a triple-monitor setup.

They weigh a hefty 2.62 pounds / 1.2kg, nearly as heavy as carrying a 13-inch MacBook Air with your ThinkBook. I saw this setup and the 2nd Display Concept in an early in-person preview, and while having a triple-monitor laptop ready on-demand seemed awesome, it was also just A Lot. The Dual Screen Concept was cumbersome to set up, fold down, and put away. On the other hand, the 2nd Display was easy to work with and felt like a no-brainer if it ever comes to market.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for the pair of Tiko concepts, I didn’t get to see them but oh boy are these such different ideas sharing the same name. Lenovo doesn’t have many details yet on the Tiko Pro horizontal screen attachment, but having an additional display for widgets seems nifty. I bet its teleprompter function would sell many units on that sole feature. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_AJohnson_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Tiko Pro Concept, because “pros” apparently need teleprompters and widgets, not emoji cat friends.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the Tiko emoji friend looks like an absolute charmer.

The Buddy was a voice-enabled AI chatbot that could also take actions on your computer for you. The Tiko Pro, at least based on Lenovo’s early indications, seems more like a lighthearted plaything you can casually interact with.

It’s a productivity / business laptop with a flexible display, allowing it to be used as a traditional 13.1-inch clamshell, a folded-up 12.9-inch tablet, or a laptop with an extra-tall 18.1-inch vertical screen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ThinkBook Flip uses the same exact OLED panel as the $3,500 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24337633/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-flexible-oled-price-specs\">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a> that’s expected to arrive sometime in June — only here, it’s set up to fold behind the main portion of the screen instead of extend out from underneath it. That means there are no motors, which could bring costs down, and none of the display is left sitting unused inside the chassis — hence the Flip’s 0.4 inches of extra screen real estate over the Gen 6.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When folded back, the Flip can be used like a normal 13-inch clamshell laptop, albeit with nearly half its screen facing backward. You can use that rear-facing portion to mirror or extend your display and present to someone else without the need for an external monitor or projector, or just leave it blank. But the real star of the show is when you flip the screen up to get all 18.1 inches / 2000 x 2664 resolution of glorious OLED for yourself. In addition to being able to view long documents and websites, it puts the webcam and top portion of the screen at a pleasing and neck-relieving eye level.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"tiktok-embed\" cite=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7477350818782432558\" data-video-id=\"7477350818782432558\" data-embed-from=\"oembed\"> <section> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"@verge\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?refer=embed\">@verge</a> <p>Lenovo is demo’ing a foldable laptop screen concept that lets you to bend the display for a double-sided mode, a tablet mode, or just to utilize a really tall 18&#8243; screen. <a title=\"lenovo\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/lenovo?refer=embed\">#lenovo</a> <a title=\"foldable\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foldable?refer=embed\">#foldable</a> <a title=\"laptop\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/laptop?refer=embed\">#laptop</a> <a title=\"concept\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/concept?refer=embed\">#concept</a> <a title=\"tech\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tech?refer=embed\">#tech</a> <a title=\"techtok\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/techtok?refer=embed\">#techtok</a> </p> <a target=\"_blank\" title=\"♬ original sound - The Verge\" href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7477350893873253166?refer=embed\">♬ original sound &#8211; The Verge</a> </section> </blockquote> \n</div></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Outside of its screen, the Flip’s other unique feature is its Smart ForcePad trackpad. It offers three color-coded layers of LED-illuminated touch shortcuts and media controls you can call up within the pad itself. They can transform the trackpad into a number pad, offer shortcuts to functions like the Snipping Tool or a mute button for your mic, or serve as an app launcher. Samuel<strong> </strong>Shang, principal researcher of Lenovo Research, told me the company’s dream setup would be to replace the touchpad with a smartphone display, but that would be too costly. The basic illuminated icons offered a fair compromise.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_AJohnson_0007.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_AJohnson_0008.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_AJohnson_0011.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/257550_Lenovo_MWC_AJohnson_0006.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" /></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Flip is still in the concept phase, Lenovo does have some estimated specs for what would go inside, which seems like a promising sign this laptop will actually come to market. It’ll use an Intel Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, PCIe SSD storage, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and feature a fingerprint reader.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The ThinkBook Flip I got to see in a brief demo ahead of MWC was an early prototype that still felt fragile and a little rough around the edges.

It’s a productivity / business laptop with a flexible display, allowing it to be used as a traditional 13.1-inch clamshell, a folded-up 12.9-inch tablet, or a laptop with an extra-tall 18.1-inch vertical screen.\nThe ThinkBook Flip uses the same exact OLED panel as the $3,500 ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 that’s expected to arrive sometime in June — only here, it’s set up to fold behind the main portion of the screen instead of extend out from underneath it. That means there are no motors, which could bring costs down, and none of the display is left sitting unused inside the chassis — hence the Flip’s 0.4 inches of extra screen real estate over the Gen 6.\nWhen folded back, the Flip can be used like a normal 13-inch clamshell laptop, albeit with nearly half its screen facing backward. You can use that rear-facing portion to mirror or extend your display and present to someone else without the need for an external monitor or projector, or just leave it blank. But the real star of the show is when you flip the screen up to get all 18.1 inches / 2000 x 2664 resolution of glorious OLED for yourself. In addition to being able to view long documents and websites, it puts the webcam and top portion of the screen at a pleasing and neck-relieving eye level.\n\n \n @verge \nLenovo is demo’ing a foldable laptop screen concept that lets you to bend the display for a double-sided mode, a tablet mode, or just to utilize a really tall 18″ screen. #lenovo #foldable #laptop #concept #tech #techtok \n ♬ original sound – The Verge \n  \n\n\nOutside of its screen, the Flip’s other unique feature is its Smart ForcePad trackpad. It offers three color-coded layers of LED-illuminated touch shortcuts and media controls you can call up within the pad itself. They can transform the trackpad into a number pad, offer shortcuts to functions like the Snipping Tool or a mute button for your mic, or serve as an app launcher. Samuel Shang, principal researcher of Lenovo Research, told me the company’s dream setup would be to replace the touchpad with a smartphone display, but that would be too costly. The basic illuminated icons offered a fair compromise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Flip is still in the concept phase, Lenovo does have some estimated specs for what would go inside, which seems like a promising sign this laptop will actually come to market. It’ll use an Intel Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, PCIe SSD storage, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and feature a fingerprint reader.\nThe ThinkBook Flip I got to see in a brief demo ahead of MWC was an early prototype that still felt fragile and a little rough around the edges.
