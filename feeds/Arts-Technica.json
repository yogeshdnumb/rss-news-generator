Sometimes a strike can even produce sonoluminescence, whereby the cavitation bubbles produce a brief flash of light as they collapse.\nAccording to a 2018 study, the secret to that powerful punch seems to arise not from bulky muscles but from the spring-loaded anatomical structure of the shrimp's arms, akin to a bow and arrow or a mousetrap. The shrimp's muscles pull on a saddle-shaped structure in the arm, causing it to bend and store potential energy, which is released with the swinging of the club-like claw. It's essentially a latch-like mechanism (technically, Latch-mediated spring actuation, or LaMSA), with small structures in the muscle tendons called sclerites serving as the latch.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/this-mantis-shrimp-inspired-robotic-arm-can-crack-an-egg/#comments","content":"\n            Device can grab like a hand, crawl across the floor, or jump high, just by pulling on a simple muscle.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Device can grab like a hand, crawl across the floor, or jump high, just by pulling on a simple muscle.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/this-mantis-shrimp-inspired-robotic-arm-can-crack-an-egg/","categories":["Science","biomimicry","biorobotics","Mantis shrimp","Robotics","soft robotics"],"isoDate":"2025-01-29T19:00:00.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Samuel Axon\n        ","title":"Sony removes PlayStation account requirement from 4 single-player Steam games","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/sony-removes-playstation-account-requirement-from-4-single-player-steam-games/","pubDate":"Wed, 29 Jan 2025 18:59:44 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Sony's game publishing arm has done a 180-degree turn on a controversial policy of requiring PC players to sign in with PlayStation accounts for some games, <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/29/new-in-game-content-incentives-coming-to-playstation-games-on-pc/\">according to a blog post</a> by the company.</p>\n<p>A PlayStation account will \"become optional\" for <em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>, and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>.
