It's also a rather unusual one, in that the supermassive black hole in question does not reside at the center of its galaxy. Instead, there's an even more massive object there, which is feeding on matter at the same time.\nA mystery object\nThe object, now called AT2024tvd, was identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility, which is set up to scan the entire northern sky over a period of just two days, after which it repeats the process. Combined with software that scans the data for changes, these repeated exposures allow the system to identify objects that suddenly brighten (or, potentially, anything that suddenly goes dark). Among the events it can identify are tidal disruption events, where a star gets spaghettified by the enormous gravity of a supermassive black hole.\nNormally, supermassive black holes live at the center of galaxies. So, the software that does the scanning will only flag something as a potential tidal disruption event if it coincides with the presence of a previous light source at the same location. And that wasn't the case with AT2024tvd, which appeared to be over 2,500 light-years from the center of the galaxy. As a result, the software didn't flag it as a potential tidal disruption event; people didn't figure out what it was until they looked more closely at it.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          John Timmer\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-star-has-been-destroyed-by-a-wandering-supermassive-black-hole/#comments","content":"\n            Second supermassive black hole is a long way from the galaxy's core.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Second supermassive black hole is a long way from the galaxy's core.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-star-has-been-destroyed-by-a-wandering-supermassive-black-hole/","categories":["Science","astronomy","astrophysics","black holes","spaghettification","supermassive black hole","tidal disruption"],"isoDate":"2025-05-09T13:37:24.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Stephen Clark\n        ","title":"Rocket Report: Rocket Lab to demo cargo delivery; America’s new ICBM in trouble","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-rocket-lab-to-demo-cargo-delivery-americas-new-icbm-in-trouble/","pubDate":"Fri, 09 May 2025 11:00:27 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Welcome to Edition 7.43 of the Rocket Report!
