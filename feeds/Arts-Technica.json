Despite running the same 500 hp (373 kW) 5.0 L Coyote engine as the road-going Dark Horse, slotted into the same chassis and bodywork, it's a far more engaging drive—and a wildly good time.\nIt all looks pretty tame from the outside, as it sports the familiar Mustang shape that has hardly changed over the last few generations. Even the wing is slender by race car standards, only subtly different from the one on the road-going Dark Horse.\nBut peek inside and you start to see the scope of the modifications. The sound-deadening material has been evicted, with leather and vinyl trimming replaced by a roll cage that spans the now-vacant space. A bright red fire extinguisher now sits where the rear seat once was.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Tim Stevens\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/driving-the-ford-mustang-dark-horse-r-makes-every-other-pony-feel-tame/#comments","content":"\n            We try Ford's latest track-only Mustang.\n          ","contentSnippet":"We try Ford's latest track-only Mustang.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/driving-the-ford-mustang-dark-horse-r-makes-every-other-pony-feel-tame/","categories":["Cars","Ford Mustang","Ford Performance"],"isoDate":"2025-01-31T17:10:36.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Kyle Orland\n        ","title":"“Just give me the f***ing links!”—Cursing disables Google’s AI overviews","link":"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/01/just-give-me-the-fing-links-cursing-disables-googles-ai-overviews/","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Jan 2025 17:00:32 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>If you search Google for a way to turn off the company's AI-powered search results, you may well get an AI Overview telling you that AI Overviews can't be directly disabled in Google Search.

Astronomers have now combined earlier observational data to learn more about the turbulent dynamics of plasma near M87*'s event horizon over time, according to a paper published in the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.\nCo-author Luciano Rezzolla of Goethe University Frankfurt in Germany likened the new analysis to comparing two photographs of Mount Everest, one year apart. While the mountain's basic structure is unlikely to change much in that time, one could observe changes in clouds near the peak and deduce from that properties like wind direction. For instance, in the case of M87*, the new analysis confirmed the presence of a luminous ring that is brightest at the bottom, which in turn confirmed that the rotational axis points away from Earth. \"More of these observations will be made in the coming years and with increasing precision, with the ultimate goal of producing a movie of what happens near M87*,\" said Rezolla.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/seven-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed-this-month/#comments","content":"\n            Peruvian mummy tattoos, the wobbly physics of spears and darts, quantum \"cat states,\" and more.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Peruvian mummy tattoos, the wobbly physics of spears and darts, quantum \"cat states,\" and more.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/seven-cool-science-stories-we-almost-missed-this-month/","categories":["Science","Archaeology","Physics","science"],"isoDate":"2025-01-31T12:30:47.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Eric Berger\n        ","title":"Rocket Report: SpaceX tosses away a Falcon 9; a Somalian spaceport?","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/rocket-report-spacex-tosses-away-a-falcon-9-a-somalian-spaceport/","pubDate":"Fri, 31 Jan 2025 12:00:23 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Welcome to Edition 7.29 of the Rocket Report!
