As Nvidia already teased, a variety of new notebooks sporting RTX 50-series GPUs now have finalized pricing, and there are fresh offerings from the likes of Asus ROG, MSI, and HP. Back when many of these laptops were first announced at CES in January, they mostly had estimated prices or no pricing at all. \nAsus’s flagship ROG Strix Scar 16, with its new wraparound RGB lighting, starts at $3,299.99 with an RTX 5080 GPU and $4,299.99 with a top-of-the-line RTX 5090. The sleeker Zephyrus G14, which is a Verge favorite for balancing gaming performance with everyday usability, starts at $2,499.99 with an RTX 5070 Ti. And the larger Zephyrus G16 starts with the same GPU at $2,699.99. The G14 can go up to the RTX 5080, but the G16 will go all the way to an RTX 5090 once those higher-end configurations come a little later.\nMSI has its RTX 5090-equipped Titan 18 HX AI is up for preorder for an astounding $5,999.99. (That’s not even MSI’s ridiculous Dragon Edition Norse Myth, which is still listed as “coming soon.”) The company has some of its slightly more down-to-Earth gaming laptops up for preorder as well, like the Stealth 18 HX AI with an RTX 5070 Ti starting at $2,999.99.\nLots of these gaming laptops are sitting at the high end with high prices, and some are more expensive than their last-gen versions with 40-series GPUs. Like, previous generations we may have to wait until cheaper mobile GPUs are announced and brought to market to get something not priced into the stratosphere. Hopefully the mobile versions of Nvidia’s new cards won’t be saddled some of the problems that have hit its latest desktop class, like mediocre improvements over their last-gen counterparts, power issues, or manufacturing missteps.","summary":"Razer is adding a fresh gaming laptop to the pile of new models up for preorder today: the Blade 18.

actions, including halting enforcement of the TikTok ban and rolling back the Biden administration’s artificial intelligence order.\nHaving already run the country once before, Trump entered the presidency with the goal of hitting the ground running, having already selected nominees and chairs for key agencies that oversee tech. This time, Trump has the backing of many tech billionaires who attended his inauguration and showed up at his home in Mar-a-Lago.\nRead on below as we keep track of all the ways Trump is leaving his mark on tech in his first 100 days in office.\nWe finally know who’s legally running DOGE\n\t\t\t\nDonald Trump broke the law by removing climate change references from USDA websites, lawsuit alleges\n\t\t\t\nThe government is still threatening to ‘semi-fire’ workers who don’t answer an email from Elon Musk\n\t\t\t\nAbout that State Department ‘estimate’ for a $400 million order of armored Teslas.\n\t\t\t\nHow much of Apple’s ‘$500 billion commitment to our country’s future’ is actually new?\n\t\t\t\nSomeone flooded HUD HQ TVs with an AI-generated video of Trump and Musk.\n\t\t\t\nConservative podcaster Dan Bongino named deputy FBI director\n\t\t\t\nThe SEC has ended its investigation into Robinhood crypto.\n\t\t\t\nApple responds to tariff threat with a $500 billion US investment plan\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk claims federal employees have 48 hours to explain recent work or resign\n\t\t\t\nDOGE asks federal workers to justify their recent work or resign.\n\t\t\t\nThe SEC drops its investigation against OpenSea.\n\t\t\t\nThe new US Social Security head was suspected of secretly feeding info to Musk’s DOGE.\n\t\t\t\nThe GSA is shutting down its EV chargers, calling them ‘not mission critical’\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk’s first month of destroying America will cost us decades\n\t\t\t\nTrump shed some light on his meeting with Tim Cook.\n\t\t\t\nCoinbase says the SEC has agreed to drop its crypto lawsuit\n\t\t\t\nI cannot describe how strange Elon Musk’s CPAC appearance was\n\t\t\t\nNot advertising on X could be bad for business.\n\t\t\t\nApple CEO Tim Cook met with President Trump today.\n\t\t\t\nSome people who accepted the ‘fork in the road’ federal resignation offer got fired anyway.\n\t\t\t\nNuclear whiplash.\n\t\t\t\nTrump administration hits disaster relief team with layoffs.\n\t\t\t\nA departing USDS leader’s thoughts on DOGE.\n\t\t\t\nTrump and Musk discuss DOGE and their relationship in a Fox News interview.\n\t\t\t\nTrump administration cancels approval for NYC congestion pricing.\n\t\t\t\nTrump issues an executive order claiming more oversight of independent agencies like the FTC and FCC.\n\t\t\t\nDOGE’s alleged cost-cutting achievements included a few extra zeroes.\n\t\t\t\nYou’re (not) fired!\n\t\t\t\nDOGE can keep accessing government data for now, judge rules\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk doesn’t work for DOGE\n\t\t\t\nDOGE is trying to access the IRS’s data on millions of taxpayers\n\t\t\t\nA team from SpaceX is being brought in to overhaul the FAA’s air traffic control system\n\t\t\t\nA US agency has been told to stop its election security work.\n\t\t\t\nTrump admin pulls hundreds of videos from CFPB’s YouTube channel\n\t\t\t\nJudge temporarily blocks mass firings at CFPB.\n\t\t\t\nThree different court hearings over DOGE just today.\n\t\t\t\nTrump administration adds anti-trans notices to restored websites\n\t\t\t\nClimate group that called for ‘free
