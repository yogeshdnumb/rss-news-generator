If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you may be better served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like<a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/hori-pad-pro-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-one/-/A-86501139\"> Hori’s Horipad Pro</a> — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.</p>\n\n<p>The only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity, though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its<a href=\"https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/configure/xbox-wireless-controller\"> Xbox Design Lab</a>, which bumps the price from $69.99 to $109.93 depending on the configuration.

It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Advantage-Wired-Controller-Xbox-Console/dp/B0C8C3JF9X/\">PowerA Advantage Wired</a>. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we&#8217;d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8bitdo-ultimate-wired-for-xbox-hero.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,4.30747263208,100,91.38505473584\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;8BitDo controllers may be inexpensive, but that doesn’t mean they should be considered cheap.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1VHH4C5\">three-mode wireless version</a> with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"IbgeAd\">The best “pro” Xbox controller</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>Up to four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features\"> Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> is Microsoft’s fancy controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and it just <em>feels </em>nice in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $179.99. There’s also the stripped-down <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340603/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-white-controller-release-date-price\">Elite Series 2 “Core” version</a> with an MSRP of <a href=\"https://howl.link/pgwtxime0k3it\">$129.99</a>, which ditches the add-ons. You can buy them separately in <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/complete-component-pack\">a $59.99 accessories pack</a>, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.</p>\n\n<p>A pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of an emotional purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels, but it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your likings, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc. while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool as when using an Elite. (And why try to get good or learn something when I can buy my way there instead?)</p>\n\n<p>While the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517317/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-hardware-issues-warranty\">extended the controller’s warranty</a> from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained\">stick drift</a> after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).&nbsp;</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23516635/adbenedetto_220508_5192_0047.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Elite Series 2 offers unprecedented customization with analog sticks and a D-pad you can pluck right off.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>Even with those heaping mouthfuls of salt, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"UwyahT\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features\">Read our Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"qMubJZ\">A formidable alternative to the Elite</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></em></p>\n\n<p>At $199.99, <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro/RZ06-05200100-R3U1\">Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro</a> controller is even more expensive than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the added cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, with a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours). Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799876/247446_Razer_Wolverine_V3_Pro_ADiBenedetto_0004.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;It’s not every day you see six buttons on top of a controller.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its&nbsp;more basic software customization, lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its very high cost. And if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Tournament-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6QT8K6\">Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition</a> that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired version.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8bTkJx\">Other Xbox controllers we tested</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/VALOR-Wired-Performance-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DTB178JG/\">Scuf Valor Pro</a> is the company’s first Xbox controller with Hall effect sticks (and its cheapest). It’s wired but otherwise builds admirably on the foundation laid by the Scuf Instinct Pro, which was once our top third-party pro-style controller. Scuf emulates Microsoft’s winning ergonomics while implementing redesigned remappable rear buttons (two are removable) and shoulder bumpers that are more comfortable to reach. It also has trigger stops that produce a satisfying click with no travel when pressed. The D-pad produces a similarly satisfying click, one we prefer over the softer tactile feel of the Instinct. The Valor Pro is not the most exciting controller on paper, but it’s a solid option for Scuf faithful or anyone who wants more durable analog sticks. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/616019/scuf-valor-pro-hands-on-impressions-wired-xbox-controller\">Read our hands-on impressions</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><span>If you’re a fan of competitive shooters, Turtle Beach controllers like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Officially-Licensed-Xbox-Windows-X/dp/B096GQBLM2\" target=\"_blank\">Recon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-REACT-R-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B64GRYJ9\" target=\"_blank\">React-R</a> have several audio features that might come in handy.</span> The company’s fanciest option, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S\">Stealth Ultra</a>, is a $200 wireless model with Hall effect sticks that’s an excellent choice overall. That being said, we still prefer the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, as the built-in customization screen on the Stealth Ultra is clunky to use and the ergonomics don’t feel nearly as nice as that of the V3 Pro.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turtle Beach also recently released the <a href=\"https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-pivot-controller\">Stealth Pivot</a>, which lets you quickly swap the analog sticks for an extra face button by swiveling the plates around. It’s neat but ultimately niche, as it’s primarily meant for fighting games and retro titles. That feature necessitates a chassis that’s noticeably bigger than most controllers, too, which may be a downer if you already struggle with standard controller sizes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We recently tested PowerA’s newest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the <a href=\"https://www.powera.com/p/fusion/controllers/wired/fusion-pro-4-wired-controller-for-xbox-xbgp0325-01/\">Fusion Pro 4 Wired</a> ($69.99) and <a href=\"https://www.powera.com/p/fusion/controllers/wireless/fusion-pro-wireless-controller-for-xbox-with-lumectra-xbgp0278-01/\">PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless</a> ($149.99). They’re standard fare for pro-style controllers these days, with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks, four remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. They’re similar, but the Pro Wireless has four trippy Lumectra lighting zones that respond to your button presses. Both controllers are satisfying to use and a clear step up from PowerA’s older products in terms of overall quality, but they ultimately don’t stand out much.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Competition-Controller-Xbox-Customization-X/dp/B09RW9DL96\">Nacon’s Revolution X</a> is one of the most customizable wired controllers you can get (it even has removable weights in its handles), and its software is nearly as expansive as Microsoft’s first-party app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Briefly mentioned above, the <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/hori-pad-pro-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-one/-/A-86501139\">Horipad Pro</a> has one of the best D-pads around. It also offers a lot of software customization at an affordable price, but its shoulder buttons are a bit stiff.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re the nostalgic type, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Wired-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited/dp/B09FYFT4NN/\">Hyperkin Duke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-DuchesS-Wired-Controller-Officially-Console/dp/B0D9638Z3J\">DuchesS</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Xenon-Controller-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C5DZHCY9\">Xenon</a> are faithful wired recreations of Xbox gamepads from Microsoft’s first two console generations.

There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors Microsoft offers.\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: No / Power: Wired\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox is a fantastic budget model that typically retails for $49.99 but can often be found for as little as $29.99. The shape is reminiscent of Nintendo’s Switch Pro Controller, only a bit smaller, with hints of Xbox influence and a curvaceous design that feels great to hold.\nOn the hardware front, the Ultimate Wired Controller features Hall effect sticks and great tension. It also uses Hall effect triggers with dedicated vibration motors, though it lacks trigger stops, unlike our previous budget pick, the PowerA Advantage Wired. Its D-pad, face buttons, and bumpers are nice and clicky, too, despite being smaller than we’d typically like. It has two rear paddles, remappable buttons, and the ability to save up to three profiles, which you can switch between on the fly using a dedicated button. There’s even a built-in mute switch for audio, which isn’t common on cheaper controllers.\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate Wired works as a wired controller with your PC, but if you prefer wireless connectivity, the company also makes a three-mode wireless version with support for both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless (via a dongle). The wireless version is a bit more expensive, however, and it’s still limited to wired connectivity on Xbox consoles. \nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fancy controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and it just feels nice in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $179.99. There’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $129.99, which ditches the add-ons. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.\nA pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of an emotional purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels, but it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your likings, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc. while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool as when using an Elite. (And why try to get good or learn something when I can buy my way there instead?)\nWhile the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers). \nEven with those heaping mouthfuls of salt, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.\nRead our Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review.\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nConnectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nAt $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is even more expensive than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the added cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, with a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours). Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.\nThe Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its more basic software customization, lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its very high cost. And if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired version.\nOther Xbox controllers we tested\nThe Scuf Valor Pro is the company’s first Xbox controller with Hall effect sticks (and its cheapest). It’s wired but otherwise builds admirably on the foundation laid by the Scuf Instinct Pro, which was once our top third-party pro-style controller. Scuf emulates Microsoft’s winning ergonomics while implementing redesigned remappable rear buttons (two are removable) and shoulder bumpers that are more comfortable to reach. It also has trigger stops that produce a satisfying click with no travel when pressed. The D-pad produces a similarly satisfying click, one we prefer over the softer tactile feel of the Instinct. The Valor Pro is not the most exciting controller on paper, but it’s a solid option for Scuf faithful or anyone who wants more durable analog sticks. Read our hands-on impressions.\nIf you’re a fan of competitive shooters, Turtle Beach controllers like the Recon and React-R have several audio features that might come in handy. The company’s fanciest option, the Stealth Ultra, is a $200 wireless model with Hall effect sticks that’s an excellent choice overall. That being said, we still prefer the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, as the built-in customization screen on the Stealth Ultra is clunky to use and the ergonomics don’t feel nearly as nice as that of the V3 Pro.\nTurtle Beach also recently released the Stealth Pivot, which lets you quickly swap the analog sticks for an extra face button by swiveling the plates around. It’s neat but ultimately niche, as it’s primarily meant for fighting games and retro titles. That feature necessitates a chassis that’s noticeably bigger than most controllers, too, which may be a downer if you already struggle with standard controller sizes.\nWe recently tested PowerA’s newest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the Fusion Pro 4 Wired ($69.99) and PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless ($149.99). They’re standard fare for pro-style controllers these days, with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks, four remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. They’re similar, but the Pro Wireless has four trippy Lumectra lighting zones that respond to your button presses. Both controllers are satisfying to use and a clear step up from PowerA’s older products in terms of overall quality, but they ultimately don’t stand out much.\nNacon’s Revolution X is one of the most customizable wired controllers you can get (it even has removable weights in its handles), and its software is nearly as expansive as Microsoft’s first-party app.\nBriefly mentioned above, the Horipad Pro has one of the best D-pads around. It also offers a lot of software customization at an affordable price, but its shoulder buttons are a bit stiff.\nIf you’re the nostalgic type, the Hyperkin Duke, DuchesS, and Xenon are faithful wired recreations of Xbox gamepads from Microsoft’s first two console generations. They’re kind of dumb but endearing (especially the chunky Duke), but they’re unique collector pieces you can also use on modern games.\nThe wired GameSir G7 SE is another budget pick with drift-resistant Hall effect sticks and USB-C connectivity, one that can typically be found for around $40. Like 8BitDo’s controllers, it neglects trigger stops, but it’s one of the only options with dedicated switches for disabling the rear buttons.\nWhat’s coming next?\nThe race to perfect Xbox controllers isn’t slowing down, it seems, as manufacturers continue updating their lineup with newer analog sticks and triggers, or experiment with novel gimmicks. Case in point: the upcoming Hyperkin Competitor, which was announced at CES in January and is set to arrive later in 2025. The wired gamepad’s design is unashamedly inspired by the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controllers, complete with glassy buttons and a noncontiguous D-pad.\nPhotography by Antonio G.

users — and it’s becoming an increasingly interesting platform to watch amid growing competition from social and metaverse platforms like Epic Games’ Fortnite and Meta’s Horizon Worlds.\nWhile Roblox has traditionally been associated as a platform for kids, the company has done a lot of work as of late to make it more appealing to older audiences. The platform now allows developers to make experiences that are exclusively accessible to users that are 17 and over, for example, and is introducing its own spin on video chat. It even has ambitions to be a place where adults can meet and date.\nThe company is also investing heavily into generative AI tools to help creators make experiences more easily, including a new

Both tablets launch on March 12th, and we’ll be updating this guide with our impressions in the coming weeks.</em></p>\n\n<p>There are no bad iPads. That’s the best news about Apple’s tablet lineup: 15 years after Steve Jobs first debuted the device, the iPad is the best tablet on the market, and it’s not particularly close. Apple’s App Store is enormous and filled with great apps, Apple’s performance and battery life are consistently excellent, and the iPad is still the company’s most versatile device. That’s one easy answer to your question: yes, if you want a tablet, you should buy an iPad. Even last year’s iPad, or heck, last-last year’s iPad, is still a solid device. Buying an older but better device — last year’s Pro instead of this year’s Air, for instance — is a tried-and-true iPad formula.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But which of all those good iPads should you buy? That’s never been more complicated. Apple sells six different iPads —&nbsp;the Pro in two sizes, the Air in two sizes, the Mini, and the regular ol’ iPad —&nbsp;all of which come with different specs and accessory options. It’s all too much.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#766tlj\">The best iPad for most people</a></li><li><a href=\"#uqb3Br\">The best iPad, period</a></li><li><a href=\"#sIvlSS\">The best iPad Mini</a></li><li><a href=\"#6h7KwO\">An aside on specs and extras</a></li><li><a href=\"#what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve tested every iPad currently on the market and have been an iPad user and reviewer since the very first model. (I’m pretty sure I got a job in 2010 because I had a brand-new iPad with me at the interview, but that’s another story.) After using all these tablets and all these accessories, I think I can help you make the choice.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we review iPads</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">iPads are incredibly versatile gadgets, so we test them in as many real-world ways as possible. We use them for video chats, we play high-end games and casual ones, we edit complex video, we fall asleep on the couch watching Netflix. We pay close attention to performance, battery life, durability, and compatibility with important apps and accessories. We’ve reviewed every iPad on the market, along with their most important competitors, and track software updates closely as they change the devices’ appeal.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Price</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Yes, this is obvious, but it’s good to know how much you want to spend before shopping — otherwise, you risk succumbing to Apple’s incredible ability to always get you spending just a little more. You can get a new iPad for as little as $350, or you can spend well over $1,000 for a top model. Knowing how much you want to pay will guide you to the right models. It might even guide you to older models; sometimes the last-gen iPad, at a steep discount, can be the one to buy.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Size</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">The most common iPad size these days has a roughly 11-inch screen. This is probably the right size for most people: 11 inches is ideal for a wide variety of things and is flexible for both holding in your hands and using with a keyboard. If you primarily plan to use your iPad for reading, you might want to go with something smaller; if you intend to replace a laptop with an iPad, you might want a bigger model. Be warned, though: a 13-inch iPad is a truly humongous thing.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Accessories</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Apple’s accessory compatibility is somewhat fragmented across its iPad lineup. It has four different Pencil stylus models, three different keyboard attachments, and a wide variety of case options. While some iPad models share accessories with others, not all of them do, so if you want to use a specific accessory with your iPad, it’s important to make sure both are compatible before you buy them.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Your iPad buying journey starts with one crucial question: what kind of iPad user are you? There are, broadly speaking, two types. The first and most common iPad user mostly uses it like a larger iPhone: it’s a bigger screen on which to send emails, do the crossword, watch Netflix, and do other fairly casual activities. The second type of iPad user, on the other hand, uses it like a touchscreen Mac: it’s for video editing, 3D modeling, creating presentations, crushing spreadsheets, and generally Doing Work of all sorts. You’ll also email and Netflix, of course, but you want your iPad to be a primary computing device.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I think I can safely assume most people fall into the first category. (Honestly, I also think a lot of people who believe they fall into the second category… mostly don’t.) For them, the choice is actually simpler than you’d think:</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"766tlj\">The best iPad for most people</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen:</strong> 10.9-inch, 2360 x 1640 resolution / <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple A14 Bionic / <strong>Storage:</strong> 64 or 256GB / <strong>Port:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Cellular:</strong> 5G (optional) / <strong>Speakers:</strong> stereo / <strong>Compatible accessories:</strong> </em><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MQDP3LL/A/magic-keyboard-folio-for-ipad-10th-generation-us-english\">Apple Magic Keyboard Folio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MUWA3AM-A-Pencil-USB-C/dp/B0CL7J12YK\">Apple Pencil&nbsp;(USB-C)</a></em></p>\n\n<p>If every iPad is a good iPad, the cheapest iPad is the obvious place to start. Apple’s base tablet is still a really solid tablet and a really good deal: you could buy the $349 tablet <em>and </em>the (wildly overpriced but still very nice) $250 Magic Keyboard Folio for the price of the iPad Air. The 10.9-inch screen is the right size for most iPad things, the camera is good and located in the right place, it supports the Apple Pencil — though not the newer Pencil Pro —&nbsp;and even its now-outdated A14 Bionic chip is plenty for most casual iPad users. All the other iPads do have slightly nicer screens, particularly the antireflective coating that helps mitigate glare, but that’s almost certainly not worth the additional price.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing the base iPad is missing these days is Apple Intelligence. But there’s not much to miss there, at least not yet.</p>\n\n<p>All that said, though: if you do want a base iPad, you shouldn’t buy it right now. The last model came out in October 2022, and Apple recently announced a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">new entry-level iPad</a>. It’s just a spec bump, but that means it will last you much longer. (It also means the existing model will likely drop in price in the coming months, if you choose to go that way.)</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"zfWFui\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23418039/apple-ipad-review-10th-gen-2022-10-9-tablet-ipados\"><strong>Read our full iPad (10th-gen) review</strong></a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"uqb3Br\"><strong>The best iPad, period</strong></h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen:</strong> 11-inch, 2420 x 1668 resolution 120Hz OLED; 13-inch, 2752 x 2064 resolution 120Hz OLED; nano-texture glass optional / <strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M4 / <strong>Storage:</strong> 256GB–2TB / <strong>Ports:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Cellular:</strong> 5G (optional) / <strong>Speakers:</strong> four / <strong>Compatible accessories:</strong> </em></em><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MWR03LL/A/magic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11%E2%80%91inch-m4-us-english-white\"><em><em>Apple Magic Keyboard</em></em></a><em><em>,</em></em><em><em> <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX2D3AM/A/apple-pencil-pro\">Apple Pencil Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MUWA3AM/A/apple-pencil-usb-c?fnode=915bc53f136527d9a7807bd9d722cfb73c0a99a3628ac07f9b9fe2d918b404b97006825d97bc424f215b8c89e13500a24af828b0da3e4bef114f703896c610365e3e57aa5729582568a16abf2325461948b29c0443ad502a19a9a0a97c58c8dd\">Pencil USB-C</a></em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you’re not worried about price tags, this is easy: the latest iPad Pro is my favorite tablet of all time.

The latest Mini is a bit of a disappointment, with a slightly underpowered processor and an old design that could have used smaller bezels and a relocated camera. But it’s still the iPad Mini, and it’s still good enough for most tablet things. If you want an iPad Mini, this is it.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"EXpfc3\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275956/apple-ipad-mini-2024-review\"><strong>Read our full iPad Mini review</strong></a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6h7KwO\">An aside on specs and extras</h2>\n\n<p>Once you’ve picked an iPad model, you still have a bunch of decisions to make. And many of them are about specs and features that will cost you hundreds of dollars. Here are my recommendations for some of the things you’ll encounter:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Cellular coverage:</strong> You probably don’t need this. Unless you live in a really remote area, Wi-Fi is available in most places. That said, I’ve found that I use cell-equipped iPads far more often when I can just pull them out and know they’re connected — there’s something about busting it out in the park or on the subway that just feels great. Plus, it’s a really useful hotspot for other devices. This isn’t the first place I’d spend my money, though.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Storage</strong>: This <em>is </em>the first place I’d spend my money. The 10th-gen iPad comes with 64GB of storage, which is fine in a pinch but will fill up <em>really </em>fast. The others — including the two forthcoming models — start with at least 128GB, which is better, but I even recommend springing for 256GB if you can afford it. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engraving</strong>: Don’t do this. It screws up returns and makes selling or giving it away harder. Just don’t do it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple Pencil:</strong> As much as I’d love for this to be an all-purpose accessory, it’s really not. Buy it (either the USB-C or the Pro) if you plan to handwrite or draw a lot. Otherwise, skip it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Magic Keyboard: </strong>This is the first accessory I’d recommend to most people —&nbsp;most people type a lot on their iPads, and it’s also a handy stand and dock for the tablet. You can find cheaper keyboard docks than Apple’s, but I haven’t found one I like better. It’s expensive no matter which model you buy, though.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s one other thing to consider as you shop for an iPad, which is that your tablet is almost certainly going to last you a long time. In normal use, you should expect your tablet to work well for at least five years, and even limp along for a few more years after that. (It’s 2025, and I know multiple people still using the iPad Air 2 from 2014 even though it doesn’t get software updates anymore.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">My gadget shopping advice is always to buy the best thing you can afford and hold onto it for as long as possible, and that’s more doable with an iPad than almost any other device category. If you have the extra $100 to spend on storage, do it. If you want to upgrade because you think AI will get more powerful in the next few years, go for it! Just make sure you know which kind of iPad user you really are, and get the best one you’ll actually make use of. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"what-s-coming-next\">What’s coming next</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this week, Apple announced an <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/621625/apple-ipad-2024-launch-price-availability\">11th-gen iPad</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/ipad/623027/apple-ipad-air-2025-launch-price-specs\">new iPad Air with an upgraded M3 chip</a>. The forthcoming tablets are set to arrive on March 12th, though never is a drastic overhaul of existing models.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The latest entry-level iPad <a href=\"http://amazon.com/dp/B0DZ7871B8/\">starts at $349</a> and features an upgraded A16 processor — the same chip used in the&nbsp;iPhone 15 and iPhone 14 Pro — along with twice as much base storage as the previous model (128GB versus 64GB). Notably, it’s the only new iPad to lack support for Apple Intelligence, though it’s likely going to remain the best iPad for most people even if it doesn’t offer any AI-powered features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The new iPad Air is also a minor spec bump. It comes in four colors and two sizes: an 11-inch configuration that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76BN5D/\">starts at $599</a> and a larger 13-inch variant that <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-13-inch-Intelligence-Display-All-Day/dp/B0DZ76QBLQ/\">starts at $799</a>. It supports Apple Intelligence and features an upgraded M3 chip, not an M4, though Apple says it’s still twice as fast as the M1-powered Air and the A14 Bionic-powered Air. Other than that, the only real change comes in the form of a new Magic Keyboard attachment, which now includes an extra row of function keys, a redesigned hinge with USB-C, and a larger trackpad. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, March 6th:</strong> Adjusted pricing/availability and added a new section on Apple’s latest entry-level iPad and the new M3 iPad Air.

Both tablets launch on March 12th, and we’ll be updating this guide with our impressions in the coming weeks.\nThere are no bad iPads. That’s the best news about Apple’s tablet lineup: 15 years after Steve Jobs first debuted the device, the iPad is the best tablet on the market, and it’s not particularly close. Apple’s App Store is enormous and filled with great apps, Apple’s performance and battery life are consistently excellent, and the iPad is still the company’s most versatile device. That’s one easy answer to your question: yes, if you want a tablet, you should buy an iPad. Even last year’s iPad, or heck, last-last year’s iPad, is still a solid device. Buying an older but better device — last year’s Pro instead of this year’s Air, for instance — is a tried-and-true iPad formula.\nBut which of all those good iPads should you buy? That’s never been more complicated. Apple sells six different iPads — the Pro in two sizes, the Air in two sizes, the Mini, and the regular ol’ iPad — all of which come with different specs and accessory options. It’s all too much.\n \n\nThe best iPad for most people\nThe best iPad, period\nThe best iPad Mini\nAn aside on specs and extras\nWhat’s coming next\n\nI’ve tested every iPad currently on the market and have been an iPad user and reviewer since the very first model. (I’m pretty sure I got a job in 2010 because I had a brand-new iPad with me at the interview, but that’s another story.) After using all these tablets and all these accessories, I think I can help you make the choice.\n\n\nHow we review iPads\niPads are incredibly versatile gadgets, so we test them in as many real-world ways as possible. We use them for video chats, we play high-end games and casual ones, we edit complex video, we fall asleep on the couch watching Netflix. We pay close attention to performance, battery life, durability, and compatibility with important apps and accessories. We’ve reviewed every iPad on the market, along with their most important competitors, and track software updates closely as they change the devices’ appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nYes, this is obvious, but it’s good to know how much you want to spend before shopping — otherwise, you risk succumbing to Apple’s incredible ability to always get you spending just a little more. You can get a new iPad for as little as $350, or you can spend well over $1,000 for a top model. Knowing how much you want to pay will guide you to the right models. It might even guide you to older models; sometimes the last-gen iPad, at a steep discount, can be the one to buy.\n\n\n\n\n\nSize\nThe most common iPad size these days has a roughly 11-inch screen. This is probably the right size for most people: 11 inches is ideal for a wide variety of things and is flexible for both holding in your hands and using with a keyboard. If you primarily plan to use your iPad for reading, you might want to go with something smaller; if you intend to replace a laptop with an iPad, you might want a bigger model. Be warned, though: a 13-inch iPad is a truly humongous thing.\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessories\nApple’s accessory compatibility is somewhat fragmented across its iPad lineup.
