Ptolemy XIII didn't care for this decision and dethroned Cleopatra in a civil war—until Julius Caesar intervened to enforce their father's original plan of co-rulership. As for Arsinoë, Caesar returned Cyprus to Egyptian rule and named her and her youngest brother (Ptolemy XIV) co-rulers. This time, it was Arsinoë who rebelled, taking command of the Egyptian army and declaring herself queen.\nShe was fairly successful at first in battling the Romans, conducting a siege against Alexandria and Cleopatra, until her disillusioned officers decided they'd had enough and secretly negotiated with Caesar to turn her over to him. Caesar agreed, and after a bit of public humiliation, he granted Arsinoë sanctuary in the temple of Artemis in Ephesus. She lived in relative peace for a few years, until Cleopatra and Mark Antony ordered her execution on the steps of the temple—a scandalous violation of the temple as a place of sanctuary. Historians disagree about Arsinoë's age when she died: Estimates range from 22 to 27.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/nope-this-skull-is-not-cleopatras-half-sister/#comments","content":"\n            Skull found in ruins of Ephesos in 1929 thought to be Arsinoë IV is actually skull of 11-14-year-old boy.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Skull found in ruins of Ephesos in 1929 thought to be Arsinoë IV is actually skull of 11-14-year-old boy.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/nope-this-skull-is-not-cleopatras-half-sister/","categories":["Science","ancient DNA","ancient egypt","anthropology","Archaeology","cleopatra","forensic archaeology"],"isoDate":"2025-01-13T19:19:20.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Andrew Cunningham\n        ","title":"Report: After many leaks, Switch 2 announcement could come “this week”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/report-after-many-leaks-switch-2-announcement-could-come-this-week/","pubDate":"Mon, 13 Jan 2025 18:34:24 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Nintendo may be getting ready to make its Switch 2 console official.

That’s why we are interested in systems where we’re able to do all the computations optically,” says Saumil Bandyopadhyay, an MIT researcher. The team implemented a complete deep neural network on a photonic chip, achieving a latency of 410 picoseconds. To put that in perspective, Bandyopadhyay’s chip could process the entire neural net it had onboard around 58 times within a single tick of the 4 GHz clock on a standard CPU.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jacek Krywko\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/getting-an-all-optical-ai-to-handle-non-linear-math/#comments","content":"\n            Instead of sensing photons and processing the results, why not process the photons?\n          ","contentSnippet":"Instead of sensing photons and processing the results, why not process the photons?","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/getting-an-all-optical-ai-to-handle-non-linear-math/","categories":["AI","Science","Computer science","optical processing","optics"],"isoDate":"2025-01-12T12:07:16.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Eric Berger\n        ","title":"New Glenn rocket is at the launch pad waiting for calm seas to land","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/01/new-glenn-rocket-is-at-the-launch-pad-waiting-for-calm-seas-to-land/","pubDate":"Sat, 11 Jan 2025 17:31:26 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p><strong>COCOA BEACH, Fla.</strong>—As it so often does in the final days before the debut of a new rocket, it all comes down to weather.
