Since there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain, the question was what was it that cleaned the brain,” Natalie Hauglund, a neuroscientist at Oxford University who led a recent study on the brain-clearing mechanism, told Ars.\nEarlier studies done mostly on mice discovered that the brain had a system that flushed its tissues with cerebrospinal fluid, which carried away waste products in a process called glymphatic clearance. “Scientists noticed that this only happened during sleep, but it was unknown what it was about sleep that initiated this cleaning process,” Hauglund explains.\nHer study found the glymphatic clearance was mediated by a hormone called norepinephrine and happened almost exclusively during the NREM sleep phase. But it only worked when sleep was natural. Anesthesia and sleeping pills shut this process down nearly completely.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jacek Krywko\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/how-sleeping-pills-interfere-with-the-brains-internal-cleaning-mechanism/#comments","content":"\n            A specialized system sends pulses of pressure through the fluids in our brain.\n          ","contentSnippet":"A specialized system sends pulses of pressure through the fluids in our brain.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/how-sleeping-pills-interfere-with-the-brains-internal-cleaning-mechanism/","categories":["Features","Science","Biology","brain","neurobiology","nREM sleep","sleeping pills"],"isoDate":"2025-01-20T16:54:35.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","title":"Peeing is contagious among chimps","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/peeing-is-contagious-among-chimps/","pubDate":"Mon, 20 Jan 2025 16:00:47 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>When ya gotta go, ya gotta go, and if it sometimes seems like the urge to pee seems more pressing when others nearby are letting loose—well, there's now a bit of science to back that up.

(The \"$6,299 camera\" referenced in Zipp's blog post title is his indication that all models of Canon's cameras face this conundrum, regardless of price point.)\nAh, but that's because Zipp did not pay. If you head to Canon's site, provide a name and email, and manage to grab the EOS Webcam utility when Canon's servers are not failing, you can connect one camera, with one default scene, at 720p, 30 frames per second and adjust everything on the camera itself if you need to. Should you pay $5 per month, or $50 per year, you can unlock EOS Webcam Utility Pro (PDF link), which provides full 60 fps video and most of the features you'd expect out of a webcam that cost hundreds fewer dollars.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kevin Purdy\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/canon-charges-50-per-year-to-use-a-900-camera-as-a-functional-webcam/#comments","content":"\n            Just because it's a good rig doesn't mean you can use it on Zoom.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Just because it's a good rig doesn't mean you can use it on Zoom.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/canon-charges-50-per-year-to-use-a-900-camera-as-a-functional-webcam/","categories":["Tech","Canon","DSLR"],"isoDate":"2025-01-17T19:36:17.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","title":"Hollywood mourns the loss of David Lynch","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/hollywood-mourns-the-loss-of-david-lynch/","pubDate":"Fri, 17 Jan 2025 18:52:05 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Visionary filmmaker <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch\">David Lynch</a>—whose work spanned midnight movie staples like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead\"><em>Eraserhead</em></a> (1977), neo-noir psychological thrillers like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)\"><em>Mulholland Drive</em></a> (2001), and beyond—<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/01/david-lynch-dead-twin-peaks-blue-velvet-elephant-man-1236258625/\">has died</a> at 78.
