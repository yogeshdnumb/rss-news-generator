Quantum physics holds that even the emptiest vacuum is teeming with energy in the form of “virtual” particles that wink in and out of existence, flying apart and coming together in an intricate quantum dance. This roiling sea of virtual particles could give rise to dark energy, giving the Universe a little extra push so that it can continue accelerating. The problem is that the quantum vacuum contains too much energy: roughly 10120 times too much.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/hints-grow-stronger-that-dark-energy-changes-over-time/#comments","content":"\n            Latest DESI results fall short of discovery threshold but strengthen evidence for dynamical dark energy.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Latest DESI results fall short of discovery threshold but strengthen evidence for dynamical dark energy.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/hints-grow-stronger-that-dark-energy-changes-over-time/","categories":["Science","cosmology","dark energy","Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument","Lambda CDM","Physics","the standard model"],"isoDate":"2025-03-19T22:00:13.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","title":"John Wick has a new target in latest Ballerina trailer","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/its-ana-de-armas-vs-john-wick-in-new-ballerina-trailer/","pubDate":"Wed, 19 Mar 2025 21:34:57 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <div class=\"ars-video\"><div class=\"relative\" allow=\"fullscreen\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNN2PoilSp4?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent\"></div><div class=\"caption font-impact dusk:text-gray-300 mb-4 mt-2 inline-flex flex-row items-stretch gap-1 text-base leading-tight text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-300\">\n    <div class=\"caption-icon bg-[left_top_5px] w-[10px] shrink-0\"></div>\n    <div class=\"caption-content\">\n      Ana de Armas stars as an assassin in training in <em>From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</em>.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Lionsgate dropped a new trailer for <em>Ballerina</em>—or, as the studio is now calling it, <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_World_of_John_Wick:_Ballerina\">From the World of John Wick: Ballerina</a>,</em> because what every film needs is a needlessly clunky title.
