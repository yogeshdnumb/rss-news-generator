But in the first episode of the season, we saw Ellie encounter a single \"smart\" infected person, a creature that retained some sense of strategy and a self-preservation instinct.

I suppose it's possible I'm forgetting something, but I think the \"some infected are actually pretty smart now\" storyline is completely new to the show. It's just one of myriad ways the show has diverged enough from the games at this point that I legitimately don't know where it's going to go or how it's going to get there at any given moment, which is equal parts fun and frustrating.</p>\n<p>I will say that the \"smart zombies\" made for my first real \"How are Ellie and Dina going to get out of this one?\" moment, as Dina's improvised cage was being actively torn apart by a smart and strong infected. But then, lo and behold, here came Deus Ex Jesse to save things with a timely re-entrance into the storyline proper.

But yeah, if you're squeamish about blood-and-guts stuff, this one's hard to watch.</p>\n<p>I do find myself becoming more of a fan of Dina and Ellie's relationship, or at least of Dina as a character. Sure, her tragic backstory's a bit trite (she defuses this criticism by pointing out in advance that it is trite), but she's smart, she can handle herself, she is a good counterweight to Ellie's rush-in-shooting impulses. They are still, as Dina points out, doing something stupid and reckless. But I am at least rooting for them to make it out alive!</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"convo kyle\">\n<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personality wise the Dina/Ellie pairing has just as many charms as the Joel/Ellie pairing from last season. But while I always felt like Joel and Ellie had a clear motivation and end goal driving them forward, the thirst for revenge pushing Dina and Ellie deeper into Seattle starts to feel less and less relevant the more time goes on.</p>\n<p>The show seems to realize this, too, stopping multiple times since Joel's death to kind of interrogate whether tracking down these killers is worth it when the alternative is just going back to Jackson and prepping for a coming baby. It's like the writers are trying to convince themselves even as they're trying (and somewhat failing, in my opinion) to convince the audience of their just and worthy cause.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"convo andrew-c\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah, I did notice the points where Our Heroes paused to ask \"are we sure we want to be doing this?\" And obviously, they <em>are</em> going to keep doing this, because we have spent all this time setting up all these different warring factions and we're going to <em>use</em> them, dang it!! But this has never been a thing that was going to bring Joel back, and it only seems like it can end in misery, especially because I assume Jesse's plot armor is not as thick as Ellie or Dina's.</div>\n<div class=\"convo kyle\"><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personally I think the \"Ellie and Dina give up on revenge and prepare to start a post-apocalyptic family (while holding off zombies)\" would have been a brave and interesting direction for a TV show. It would have been even braver for the game, although very difficult for a franchise where the main verbs are \"shoot\" and \"stab.\"</div>\n<div class=\"convo andrew-c\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Yeah if <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> had been a city-building simulator where you swap back and forth between managing the economy of a large town and building defenses to keep out the hordes, fans of the first game might have been put off. But as an <em>Adventure of Link</em> fan I say: bring on the sequels with few-if-any gameplay similarities to their predecessors!</div>\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1.jpg\" class=\"fullwidth full\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1.jpg 1920w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1-640x427.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1-980x653.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bella-ramsey_1-1440x960.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\">\n      The cordyceps threat keeps evolving.\n        Credit:\n          HBO\n      \n<div class=\"convo kyle\">\n<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: \"We killed Joel\" team member Nora definitely would have preferred if Ellie and Dina were playing that more domestic kind of game.

It's also a rather unusual one, in that the supermassive black hole in question does not reside at the center of its galaxy. Instead, there's an even more massive object there, which is feeding on matter at the same time.\nA mystery object\nThe object, now called AT2024tvd, was identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility, which is set up to scan the entire northern sky over a period of just two days, after which it repeats the process. Combined with software that scans the data for changes, these repeated exposures allow the system to identify objects that suddenly brighten (or, potentially, anything that suddenly goes dark). Among the events it can identify are tidal disruption events, where a star gets spaghettified by the enormous gravity of a supermassive black hole.\nNormally, supermassive black holes live at the center of galaxies. So, the software that does the scanning will only flag something as a potential tidal disruption event if it coincides with the presence of a previous light source at the same location. And that wasn't the case with AT2024tvd, which appeared to be over 2,500 light-years from the center of the galaxy. As a result, the software didn't flag it as a potential tidal disruption event; people didn't figure out what it was until they looked more closely at it.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          John Timmer\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-star-has-been-destroyed-by-a-wandering-supermassive-black-hole/#comments","content":"\n            Second supermassive black hole is a long way from the galaxy's core.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Second supermassive black hole is a long way from the galaxy's core.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/a-star-has-been-destroyed-by-a-wandering-supermassive-black-hole/","categories":["Science","astronomy","astrophysics","black holes","spaghettification","supermassive black hole","tidal disruption"],"isoDate":"2025-05-09T13:37:24.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Stephen Clark\n        ","title":"Rocket Report: Rocket Lab to demo cargo delivery; America’s new ICBM in trouble","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/rocket-report-rocket-lab-to-demo-cargo-delivery-americas-new-icbm-in-trouble/","pubDate":"Fri, 09 May 2025 11:00:27 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Welcome to Edition 7.43 of the Rocket Report!
