After debuting its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/661773/whoop-5-news-price-specs-battery\">Whoop 5.0 fitness tracker</a>, users were angered to find it had reneged on a promise of free hardware upgrades. In a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/whoop/comments/1kj252l/megathread_clarifying_and_updating_our_upgrade/\">new Reddit post</a>, the company now says users who have more than 12 months left on their subscription can get the Whoop 5.0 for free.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Part of the outrage was prompted by Whoop’s confusing messaging. Early yesterday morning, my colleague <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/664111/whoop-5-0-upgrade-anger-wearables\">Victoria Song reported</a> that to get a Whoop 5.0 band, users would need to extend their existing membership by an additional 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee. However, until at least March 28th of this year, Whoop’s website <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20250328102036/https://www.whoop.com/us/en/thelocker/best-fitness-trackers/\">had a blog post</a> that said users would only need to have been a member for at least six months to get a free upgrade to next-gen hardware.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After the backlash, Whoop is now changing its tune — somewhat. Those with “more than 12 months remaining” are “eligible for a free upgrade to WHOOP 5.0 on Peak,” one of its new subscription offerings. Those with less than 12 months left still have to either extend their membership another 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee, the company says. The same information is reflected in an <a href=\"https://support.whoop.com/s/article/Membership-Pricing?language=en_US#:~:text=Starting%20Friday%2C%20May%209th%3A\">update on its membership pricing page</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The company addresses the earlier blog post, writing that “a previous blog article incorrectly stated that anyone who had been a member for just 6 months would receive a free upgrade.
