The 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X3D are both launching on March 12 for $599 and $699, respectively, the same as the launch pricing for the last-generation 7900X3D and 7950X3D but a couple hundred dollars more expensive than the current street pricing for the Ryzen 9900X and 9950X.\nAMD recommends the 9900X3D and 9950X3D to people whose gaming PCs also do other heavy-duty non-gaming work or for streamers whose gaming PCs are simultaneously running other apps. But they might also appeal to people who would normally just buy a 9800X3D because that processor has been difficult to find at its $479 MSRP since launching last fall. If a 9800X3D already costs nearly $600, why not spring for a faster chip if you can get one?\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Andrew Cunningham\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-says-top-tier-ryzen-9900x3d-and-9950x3d-cpus-arrive-march-12-for-599-and-699/#comments","content":"\n            Inflated pricing for the 9800X3D might make these more appealing to some buyers.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Inflated pricing for the 9800X3D might make these more appealing to some buyers.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/amd-says-top-tier-ryzen-9900x3d-and-9950x3d-cpus-arrive-march-12-for-599-and-699/","categories":["Gaming","Tech","AMD","Ryzen","Ryzen 9800X3D","Ryzen 9900x3d","Ryzen 9950x3d","zen 5"],"isoDate":"2025-03-07T17:27:48.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Eric Berger\n        ","title":"After less than a day, the Athena lander is dead on the Moon","link":"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/after-less-than-a-day-the-athena-lander-is-dead-on-the-moon/","pubDate":"Fri, 07 Mar 2025 16:01:22 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Intuitive Machines announced on Friday morning that its <em>Athena</em> mission to the surface of the Moon, which landed on its side, has ended.</p>\n<p>\"With the direction of the Sun, the orientation of the solar panels, and extreme cold temperatures in the crater, Intuitive Machines does not expect Athena to recharge,\" <a href=\"https://www.intuitivemachines.com/im-2\">the company said</a> in a statement. \"The mission has concluded and teams are continuing to assess the data collected throughout the mission.\"</p>\n<p><em>Athena</em>, a commercially developed lander, touched down on the lunar surface on Thursday at 11:28 am local time in Houston (17:28 UTC). The probe landed within 250 meters of its targeted landing site in the Mons Mouton region of the Moon.
