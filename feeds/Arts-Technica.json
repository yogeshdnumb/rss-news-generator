One report suggests Starlink could obtain $10 billion to $20 billion under the new rules.\nSecretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick criticized the Biden administration's handling of the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program in a statement yesterday. Lutnick said that \"because of the prior Administration's woke mandates, favoritism towards certain technologies, and burdensome regulations, the program has not connected a single person to the Internet and is in dire need of a readjustment.\"\nThe BEAD program was authorized by Congress in November 2021, and the US was finalizing plans to distribute funding before Trump's inauguration. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), part of the Commerce Department, developed rules for the program in the Biden era and approved initial funding plans submitted by every state and territory.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jon Brodkin\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/#comments","content":"\n            Trump admin decides fiber Internet won't be prioritized in BEAD grant program.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Trump admin decides fiber Internet won't be prioritized in BEAD grant program.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/starlink-benefits-as-trump-admin-rewrites-rules-for-42b-grant-program/","categories":["Policy","access","and Deployment program","BEAD program","Broadband Equity","Elon Musk","starlink"],"isoDate":"2025-03-06T19:47:21.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Beth Mole\n        ","title":"Norovirus vaccine hints at defusing explosive stomach bug in early trial","link":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/saliva-that-fights-norovirus-experimental-oral-vaccine-is-nothing-to-spit-at/","pubDate":"Thu, 06 Mar 2025 19:32:40 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>In an early clinical trial, an experimental norovirus vaccine given as a pill produced defensive responses exactly where it counts—in the saliva of older people most vulnerable to the explosive stomach bug.</p>\n<p>The results, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.ads0556\">published this week in Science Translational Medicine</a>, are another step in the long effort to thwart the gruesome germ, which finds a way to violently hollow out innards wherever people go—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/chipotle-faces-federal-criminal-probe-for-one-of-its-several-outbreaks/\">from restaurants</a> to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/06/the-grand-canyon-is-brimming-with-norovirus-sickening-over-150/\">natural wonders</a> and even <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/04/cruise-industry-salty-over-cdc-plan-to-keep-travelers-safe-from-covid-at-sea/\">the high seas</a>.

The animal looked like the typical black-and-white cow farmers raise for milk, except for one thing: Researchers had outfitted Cow D with an artificial fistula—a hole offering them a way to reach the microbes inhabiting the animal’s bathtub-size stomach. But it’s what happened next that offers a porthole into the global debate over the use of genetic data.</p>\n<p>In the spring of 2009, Samantha Noel, then a doctoral researcher at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand, reached into Cow D’s rumen and plucked out a strain of Lachnospiraceae bacterium, later dubbed ND2006. Another team of geneticists sequenced the microbe’s complete set of genes, or genome, and uploaded the information, which was then shared with GenBank, a public database run by the US National Institutes of Health. If genes are the book of life, then this process was like adding a digital copy to an online library. In policy circles, these lines of code go by another name: digital sequence information, or DSI.</p>\n<p>Eventually, a section of the sequence found inside Cow D caught the attention of scientists on the other side of the world.

The animal looked like the typical black-and-white cow farmers raise for milk, except for one thing: Researchers had outfitted Cow D with an artificial fistula—a hole offering them a way to reach the microbes inhabiting the animal’s bathtub-size stomach. But it’s what happened next that offers a porthole into the global debate over the use of genetic data.\nIn the spring of 2009, Samantha Noel, then a doctoral researcher at Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand, reached into Cow D’s rumen and plucked out a strain of Lachnospiraceae bacterium, later dubbed ND2006. Another team of geneticists sequenced the microbe’s complete set of genes, or genome, and uploaded the information, which was then shared with GenBank, a public database run by the US National Institutes of Health.
