There’s no optical heart rate monitor or fancy-schmancy OLED display, though it does boast an onboard accelerometer for tracking your steps, up to two years of battery life on a single CR2016 coin cell battery, and Bluetooth for pairing it with your phone. Doing so lets you view a basic activity log in the Casio app while ensuring you always have the correct time on hand (a wild concept, I know).</p>\n<p id=\"cobCzT\">You get some basic wristwatch functionality as well — including a stopwatch, a timer, and an alarm — but the appeal of the WS-B1000 isn’t what it offers but what it lacks. For someone like me who’s burnt out on push notifications and rarely tracks anything beyond steps, a cheap tracker with some Y2K vibes<em> </em>is a welcome reprieve.</p>\n<h4 id=\"IT5KKv\">\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24206037/casio-ws-b1000-review-smartwatch-wearable\">Read our Casio WS-B1000 review</a>.</h4>\n<div id=\"FRWdSC\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12385930\"></div></div>\n<h2 id=\"SzrHKj\">Other ways to save this weekend</h2>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"mStxOw\">Samsung held its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24348685/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-event-announcements-products\">latest Unpacked event</a> this week, providing us with a closer look at its forthcoming slate of Galaxy phones.

That being said, the bare-bones Casio WS-B1000, which is currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart for an all-time low of $39.10 (about $17 off), is not exactly one of them.\n\n\nAt its core, the WS-B1000 is a lightweight wristwatch with some basic smarts, retro styling, and a few different color options. There’s no optical heart rate monitor or fancy-schmancy OLED display, though it does boast an onboard accelerometer for tracking your steps, up to two years of battery life on a single CR2016 coin cell battery, and Bluetooth for pairing it with your phone. Doing so lets you view a basic activity log in the Casio app while ensuring you always have the correct time on hand (a wild concept, I know).\nYou get some basic wristwatch functionality as well — including a stopwatch, a timer, and an alarm — but the appeal of the WS-B1000 isn’t what it offers but what it lacks.
