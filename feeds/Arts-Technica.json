And while I still don't want to give too much away, I will say that human-versus-human drama is definitely going to be an increasingly central part of the narrative going forward.\n<p>Speaking of which, I wondered what you made of the brief scenes we get with Abby leading a reluctant but willing band of revenge-seekers that see doctor-murdering Joel as an unalloyed evil (somewhat justifiably, especially from their point of view).</p></div>\n<div class=\"convo andrew-c\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: My first thought was “look at all these clean, hot, well-coiffed apocalypse survivors.” At least Joel and Ellie both look a little weathered.\n<p>But in seriousness, yes, it’s obvious that What Joel Did is a bomb that’s going to go off sooner rather than later. Trying to address it without addressing it has pushed taciturn, closed-off Joel into therapy, where he insists to a woman whose (presumably infected) husband he killed that he’s a “good guy.” And it seems clear to me that Ellie’s shunning of Joel is coming from her sense that something is amiss, just as much as it is about a 19-year-old rebelling against her would-be father figure.</p>\n<p>In Joel’s case, it’s telling that it seems like lying to Ellie is weighing on him more than the murder-rampage itself. But having these improbably fresh-faced Firefly remnants chasing him down will mean that he might end up paying for both.</p></div>\n<div class=\"convo kyle\"><strong>Kyle</strong>: I think Joel can live with sacrificing the entire world to save Ellie. I don't think he can live with Ellie knowing he did that pretty much against her explicit wishes.</div>\n<div class=\"convo andrew-c\"><strong>Andrew</strong>: Oops!!

Can’t we all just move on?\n<p>As we close, and while at least trying to avoid spoilers, are there any game moments you’re looking forward to seeing?

That's because a large chunk of it was the first bit of the game Sony ever showed during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMW_sycSs30\">a memorable E3 2018 press conference</a>, which would end up being the company's last ever official E3 press presentation.\n<p>Besides making me an instant fan of the song \".44 Pistol,\" that scene had me very excited to see how the social adventures of \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Growed_Up\">All Growed Up</a>\" Ellie might develop.

Fungus is still a maximally creepy and visually interesting way for an infection to spread, and it’s a visual note that helps TLoU stand out from other zombie stories.\nIt does seem like we’re moving into Phase 2 of most zombie apocalypse fiction. Phase 1 is: There’s an infection! Society collapses. Phase 2 is: Humanity attempts to rebuild. But maybe the scariest monster of all… is humankind??\nI’ve always found Phase 2 to be inherently less interesting because I can watch all kinds of shows where people are the antagonists, but Joel and Ellie remain unique and compelling enough as characters that maybe they’ll carry me through.\n\n\n      A teenager should have some hobbies.\n        Credit:\n          Warner Bros. Discovery\n      \nKyle: The first game already established a lot in the way of \"humans are the real monsters\" vignettes. And while I still don't want to give too much away, I will say that human-versus-human drama is definitely going to be an increasingly central part of the narrative going forward.\nSpeaking of which, I wondered what you made of the brief scenes we get with Abby leading a reluctant but willing band of revenge-seekers that see doctor-murdering Joel as an unalloyed evil (somewhat justifiably, especially from their point of view).\n\nAndrew: My first thought was “look at all these clean, hot, well-coiffed apocalypse survivors.” At least Joel and Ellie both look a little weathered.\nBut in seriousness, yes, it’s obvious that What Joel Did is a bomb that’s going to go off sooner rather than later. Trying to address it without addressing it has pushed taciturn, closed-off Joel into therapy, where he insists to a woman whose (presumably infected) husband he killed that he’s a “good guy.” And it seems clear to me that Ellie’s shunning of Joel is coming from her sense that something is amiss, just as much as it is about a 19-year-old rebelling against her would-be father figure.\nIn Joel’s case, it’s telling that it seems like lying to Ellie is weighing on him more than the murder-rampage itself. But having these improbably fresh-faced Firefly remnants chasing him down will mean that he might end up paying for both.\n\nKyle: I think Joel can live with sacrificing the entire world to save Ellie. I don't think he can live with Ellie knowing he did that pretty much against her explicit wishes.\nAndrew: Oops!! Pobody’s nerfect!\nKyle: I'm sure Abby will understand if Joel just says he made an oopsie.\nAndrew: Seriously. Can’t believe they’re still mad even after a five-year time jump. Can’t we all just move on?\nAs we close, and while at least trying to avoid spoilers, are there any game moments you’re looking forward to seeing? Or are you just hoping that this season can “fix” a story that didn’t work as well for you in video game form?\nKyle: Actually, I don't have to spoil anything to say that the scene at the dance was one I was looking forward to seeing in both the game and the show. That's because a large chunk of it was the first bit of the game Sony ever showed during a memorable E3 2018 press conference, which would end up being the company's last ever official E3 press presentation.\nBesides making me an instant fan of the song \".44 Pistol,\" that scene had me very excited to see how the social adventures of \"All Growed Up\" Ellie might develop. And while I don't feel like the game really delivered a very satisfying or believable version of Ellie's evolution, I'm hopeful the show might be able to smooth out some of the rough storytelling edges and give a more compelling version of the character.\n\nAndrew: Yeah. Video games get remastered, but they mostly seek to preserve the original game rather than overhauling it. A well-funded multiseason TV adaptation is a rare opportunity for a redo.\nKyle: The way HBO handled the first season gives me hope that they can once again embrace the excellent world-building of the games while adding some prestige TV polish to the plot.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kyle Orland & Andrew Cunningham\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-back-for-season-2-and-so-are-we/#comments","content":"\n            One game-player and one newbie return to recap HBO's fungal free-for-all.\n          ","contentSnippet":"One game-player and one newbie return to recap HBO's fungal free-for-all.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/hbos-the-last-of-us-is-back-for-season-2-and-so-are-we/","categories":["Culture","the last of us"],"isoDate":"2025-04-14T12:00:24.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jeremy Reimer\n        ","title":"An Ars Technica history of the Internet, part 1","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/a-history-of-the-internet-part-1-an-arpa-dream-takes-form/","pubDate":"Mon, 14 Apr 2025 11:00:17 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>In a very real sense, the Internet, this marvelous worldwide digital communications network that you’re using right now, was created because one man was annoyed at having too many computer terminals in his office.</p>\n<p>The year was 1966.
