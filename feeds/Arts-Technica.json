Google confirmed what many suspected last week, that it will <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/end-of-life-gemini-will-completely-replace-google-assistant-later-this-year/\">transition everyone to Gemini in 2025</a>. Assistant holdouts may find it hard to stay on Google's old system until the end, though. Google has confirmed some popular Assistant features are being removed in the coming weeks. You may not miss all of them, but others could force a change to your daily routine.</p>\n<p>As Google has increasingly become totally consumed by Gemini, it was a foregone conclusion that Assistant would get the ax eventually. In 2024, Google removed features like media alarms and voice messages, but that was just the start. The full list of removals is still available on its <a href=\"https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?hl=en#zippy=%2Cassistant-changes\">support page</a> (spotted by <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2025/03/16/google-assistant-losing-features-2025/\">9to5Google</a>), but there's now a new batch of features at the top. Here's a rundown of what's on the chopping block.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Favorite, share, and ask where and when your photos were taken with your voice</li>\n<li>Change photo frame settings or ambient screen settings with your voice</li>\n<li>Translate your live conversation with someone who doesn’t speak your language with interpreter mode</li>\n<li>Get birthday reminder notifications as part of Routines</li>\n<li>Ask to schedule or hear previously scheduled Family Bell announcements</li>\n<li>Get daily updates from your Assistant, like “send me the weather everyday”</li>\n<li>Use Google Assistant on car accessories that have a Bluetooth connection or AUX plug</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these are no great loss—you'll probably live without the ability to get automatic birthday reminders or change smart display screensavers by voice. However, others are popular features that Google has promoted aggressively. For example, interpreter mode made a splash in 2019 and has been offering real-time translations ever since; Assistant can only translate a single phrase now. Many folks also use the scheduled updates in Assistant as part of their morning routine. Family Bell is much beloved, too, allowing Assistant to make custom announcements and interactive checklists, which can be handy for getting kids going in the morning.

Google confirmed what many suspected last week, that it will transition everyone to Gemini in 2025. Assistant holdouts may find it hard to stay on Google's old system until the end, though. Google has confirmed some popular Assistant features are being removed in the coming weeks. You may not miss all of them, but others could force a change to your daily routine.\nAs Google has increasingly become totally consumed by Gemini, it was a foregone conclusion that Assistant would get the ax eventually. In 2024, Google removed features like media alarms and voice messages, but that was just the start. The full list of removals is still available on its support page (spotted by 9to5Google), but there's now a new batch of features at the top. Here's a rundown of what's on the chopping block.\nFavorite, share, and ask where and when your photos were taken with your voice\nChange photo frame settings or ambient screen settings with your voice\nTranslate your live conversation with someone who doesn’t speak your language with interpreter mode\nGet birthday reminder notifications as part of Routines\nAsk to schedule or hear previously scheduled Family Bell announcements\nGet daily updates from your Assistant, like “send me the weather everyday”\nUse Google Assistant on car accessories that have a Bluetooth connection or AUX plug\nSome of these are no great loss—you'll probably live without the ability to get automatic birthday reminders or change smart display screensavers by voice. However, others are popular features that Google has promoted aggressively. For example, interpreter mode made a splash in 2019 and has been offering real-time translations ever since; Assistant can only translate a single phrase now. Many folks also use the scheduled updates in Assistant as part of their morning routine. Family Bell is much beloved, too, allowing Assistant to make custom announcements and interactive checklists, which can be handy for getting kids going in the morning. Attempting to trigger some of these features will offer a warning that they will go away soon.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Ryan Whitwam\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/why-wait-google-is-already-dismantling-assistant-as-it-switches-to-gemini/#comments","content":"\n            Assistant is becoming less helpful as Google \"prioritizes\" experiences. \n          ","contentSnippet":"Assistant is becoming less helpful as Google \"prioritizes\" experiences.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/why-wait-google-is-already-dismantling-assistant-as-it-switches-to-gemini/","categories":["AI","Google","Tech","google","Google Assistant","Google Gemini"],"isoDate":"2025-03-17T16:06:06.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jonathan M.

Actions are a core means of implementing what's known as CI/CD, short for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery).\nScraping server memory at scale\nOn Friday or earlier, the source code for all versions of tj-actions/changed-files received unauthorized updates that changed the \"tags\" developers use to reference specific code versions. The tags pointed to a publicly available file that copies the internal memory of severs running it, searches for credentials, and writes them to a log. In the aftermath, many publicly accessible repositories running tj-actions ended up displaying their most sensitive credentials in logs anyone could view.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Dan Goodin\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/03/supply-chain-attack-exposing-credentials-affects-23k-users-of-tj-actions/#comments","content":"\n            tj-actions/changed-files corrupted to run credential-stealing memory scraper.\n          ","contentSnippet":"tj-actions/changed-files corrupted to run credential-stealing memory scraper.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/03/supply-chain-attack-exposing-credentials-affects-23k-users-of-tj-actions/","categories":["Biz & IT","Security","Open source software","supply chain attack","tj-actions"],"isoDate":"2025-03-17T02:24:09.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","title":"Behind the scenes of The Electric State","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/03/behind-the-scenes-of-the-electric-state/","pubDate":"Sat, 15 Mar 2025 15:44:22 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Anthony and Joe Russo's new sci-fi adventure film, <em>The Electric State</em>, is adapted from the graphic novel by Swedish artist/designer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_St%C3%A5lenhag\">Simon Stålenhag</a>.
