In that case, it’s a lot better to have a bulk download strategy.</p>\n<p id=\"WbPwce\">To find out how to do that, I went into TikTok and waded through a group of videos offering different methods for downloading your content. I tried several of the methods and found three that worked relatively painlessly. (All, incidentally, need to be done on a computer rather than a phone.) </p>\n<p id=\"7ZLYfn\">A caveat before I begin: not being an actual TikTok creator, I only had two published TikTok videos on my account, which I had made as an experiment some time ago. As a result, it didn’t take much time for me to download them using any of the methods. If you’re a true TikTok creator, expect downloads and conversions to take some time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"FIjCic\">The easy way: use Repurpose.io</h2>\n<p id=\"w7JUE3\">Several people recommended an app called <a href=\"https://repurpose.io/\">Repurpose.io</a>. This is not a free app — it costs $35 a month or $349 a year. For a short time, Repurpose.io was offering free downloads from TikTok to Google Drive and Dropbox but had to withdraw the offer “<a href=\"https://repurpose.io/tiktok-download-without-watermark/\">due to high demand</a>.” However, you still get to download 10 videos for free over 14 days, so you can try it out first. </p>\n<p id=\"R9rsIT\">Repurpose.io lets you distribute your content on different platforms: you simply tell it where to upload the videos (besides TikTok, it will pull data from Instagram, YouTube, Zoom, and a number of other services) and where you want it to send them (besides Instagram and other services, you can save them to Dropbox, SoundCloud, Google Drive, and other apps). You can schedule regular transfers, repurpose only future content or all existing content, and even create clips (if, for example, you are sending YouTube videos to TikTok).</p>\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Repurpose.io screen showing a transfer from TikTok to Google Drive.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lQ5_yypg2wXPc1Wc2BgOi_PHz6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25831664/Screenshot_2025_01_13_at_5.10.08_PM.jpeg\">\n      <cite>Screenshot: Repurpose.io</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The Repurpose.io app is not free but does make it easy to transfer your TikTok videos to another platform.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"Dp9rYQ\">When I tried it, Repurpose.io easily picked up my two TikTok videos and transferred them to my Google Drive in a couple of minutes. While it should take a <em>lot</em> longer if you have, say, several hundred videos, the interface keeps you up to date on which videos have been transferred and how many are left.</p>\n<p id=\"tyopbH\">The paid app allows you to transfer an unlimited number of published videos to up to five different accounts. It could make a lot of sense if you are a dedicated TikTok video creator and are thinking of moving your videos to another service.</p>\n<h2 id=\"b5V6ii\">The interesting way: use the DevTools console</h2>\n<p id=\"F7K46M\"><em>(</em><em><strong>Update</strong></em><em>: as of January 18th, DownloadTok appears to be unavailable with a 503 error.

A consultant named Joanne Moxam has published <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC26dRDroBs\">a handy step-by-step YouTube video</a> on how to use Chrome’s browser console to save all your links in one fell swoop, move the data to a spreadsheet, and then use an online tool to bulk download your videos.</p>\n<p id=\"pjoao6\">Below, I’ve summarized the steps that Moxam suggests (which I successfully tried). She strongly recommends that you do this by using the Chrome browser.</p>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"9GEVFv\">Go to your <strong>Profile</strong> page (by clicking on your personal icon in the top-right corner).</li>\n<li id=\"r45r9a\">Bring up the browser console by <strong>hitting the F12 key</strong>. (If you’re on a Mac, you may need to use Fn-F12.) You’ll see a window open on the right filled with code; if you’re not used to that, don’t let it bother you — you won’t have to deal too much with it. Just make sure that the menu at the very top (which will say Elements / Console / Sources) has <strong>Console</strong> underlined.</li>\n<li id=\"jhL1jM\">At the bottom of the console, where there is a single &gt;, paste in the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote><p id=\"narOjG\">let goToBottom = setInterval(() =&gt; window.scrollBy(0, 400), 1000);</p></blockquote>\n<p id=\"9Tpsri\">According to Moxam, this scrolls all your videos down to the bottom, making them part of a single window so they can be selected.</p>\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"A TikTok page on a computer with a column of code on the right.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkPGh0MeTVRpSxYkH4yKAGjeCFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25831679/Screenshot_2025_01_14_at_5.15.01_PM.png\">\n      <cite>Screenshot: TikTok</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>At the bottom of the console (at right) is a space where you can paste your code.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<p id=\"WeTZeD\">Note: you may see a warning not to paste code into the console that you don’t understand; you’ll be asked to type “allow pasting” and hit <strong>Enter</strong> first.

(Note: since I was only downloading a couple of videos, I had no problems; as Moxam suggests, if you’re dealing with large numbers, you may want to download in batches of 50 or so in order to not overwhelm the app.)</li>\n<li id=\"qpwjTC\">Click the <strong>Download</strong> button.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\"Screen of tokdownload showing code in an upper window, two download buttons, and two screens from videos.\" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUYmBIGW1ljlpdBIBANa8gB0daU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25831688/Screenshot_2025_01_14_at_12.04.05_PM.jpeg\">\n      <cite>Screenshot: TOKdownload</cite>\n      <figcaption><em>The online TOKdownload app can download your videos in MP4 format.</em></figcaption>\n  </figure>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"SiBWkS\">The app will download and process the links both as the videos and covers.

This particular method is courtesy of TikToker <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bari.cait/video/7459450062683426094\">bari.cait</a> — it involves using a free Chrome app in a somewhat roundabout but effective way.

Why? Because the app that you’ll use only lets you download videos you favorite or videos from people you follow (and you can’t exactly follow yourself).

Around 9PM ET, the app began notifying people in the US with a message that said the ban will “make our services temporarily unavailable.” </p>\n<p id=\"aHXCvh\">The message goes on to say that TikTok is “working to restore our service in the US as quickly as possible” — an outcome that will require action from the incoming Trump administration one way or another. A similar message is showing up in the CapCut video editor, which is also owned by TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>\n<p id=\"lUsm8I\">Inside TikTok, an internal memo viewed by <em>The Verge </em>calls the news “disappointing” but tells employees that, “President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office” on the 20th, and “teams are working tirelessly to bring our app back to the U.S. as soon as possible.” Shortly after the memo was shared with employees, both TikTok and Capcut <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346961/tiktok-shut-down-banned-in-the-us\">started showing the same line about Trump to users</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"OOy1oT\">TikTok crashed into this outcome somewhat chaotically. It has known this was the deadline for being banned since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139036/biden-signs-tiktok-ban-bill-divest-foreign-aid-package\">Biden signed the bill</a> in April, but the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24346335/tiktok-bytedance-us-ban-project-texas\">never appeared to have a backup plan</a> to save itself if the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24340235/supreme-court-tiktok-divest-ban-first-amendment\">Supreme Court ruled the law was constitutional</a>, which happened on Friday. At the same time, TikTok was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24346211/tiktok-tells-advertisers-its-optimistic-about-finding-the-best-path-forward\">promising advertisers</a> it would sort things out as recently as last night.</p>\n<p id=\"vF3RpS\">TikTok <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24346272/tiktok-offline-threat-biden-trump-us-ban\">warned on Friday</a> that it would be forced to go dark if the Biden administration didn’t promise to delay enforcement of the law penalties on TikTok’s service providers, like Apple and Google, which can be fined thousands of dollars per US user once the ban goes into effect.

Around 9PM ET, the app began notifying people in the US with a message that said the ban will “make our services temporarily unavailable.” \nThe message goes on to say that TikTok is “working to restore our service in the US as quickly as possible” — an outcome that will require action from the incoming Trump administration one way or another. A similar message is showing up in the CapCut video editor, which is also owned by TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance.\nInside TikTok, an internal memo viewed by The Verge calls the news “disappointing” but tells employees that, “President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office” on the 20th, and “teams are working tirelessly to bring our app back to the U.S. as soon as possible.” Shortly after the memo was shared with employees, both TikTok and Capcut started showing the same line about Trump to users.\nTikTok crashed into this outcome somewhat chaotically. It has known this was the deadline for being banned since Biden signed the bill in April, but the company never appeared to have a backup plan to save itself if the Supreme Court ruled the law was constitutional, which happened on Friday. At the same time, TikTok was promising advertisers it would sort things out as recently as last night.\nTikTok warned on Friday that it would be forced to go dark if the Biden administration didn’t promise to delay enforcement of the law penalties on TikTok’s service providers, like Apple and Google, which can be fined thousands of dollars per US user once the ban goes into effect. In response, the Biden administration said it had already passed enforcement responsibilities on to the Trump administration and called TikTok’s threat to go offline a “stunt.”\nTrump — who tired to ban TikTok five years ago — has indicated he plans to extend the deadline for the ban by 90 days via an executive order once he is sworn in on January 20th. It’s not clear if he will use the provision in the law that allows for a delay if a sale is pending, or if he even has that option once the ban goes into effect. TikTok’s users are decidedly upset, of course, although none of them seem to be pressuring the company to sell as much as they’re pressuring politicians from both parties to rescind the ban.\nUpdate, January 18th: Noted that TikTok and CapCut app shutdowns have begun in the US.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346883/tiktok-shutdown-offline-us-ban","isoDate":"2025-01-19T02:00:12.000Z"},{"title":"Genshin Impact’s developer to pay $20 million fine to settle FTC charges","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/18/24346862/genshin-impact-developer-20-million-fine-ftc-data-lootboxes","pubDate":"2025-01-18T23:55:01.000Z","author":"Wes Davis","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Genshin Impact on the iPhone 14 Plus’ screen\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hbHTJBlp21qDp8VxvoBkaLDnQo=/185x168:1748x1210/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73855402/DSC03735_processed.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Genshin Impact <em>developer Cognosphere has to change the way it does loot boxes.</em> | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"JjDb93\">The Federal Trade Commission <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental\">announced on Friday</a> that <em>Genshin Impact</em> developer Cognosphere has agreed to a $20 million settlement and several restrictions on how it sells its loot boxes and manages children’s personal data.
