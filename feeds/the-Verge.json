The gamepads on the market now are higher quality, more versatile, and more customizable than anything from just a few console generations ago. If you play on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you can choose between several high-quality controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, Nacon, and Turtle Beach, some of which have even started using drift-proof <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23571821/nintendo-switch-joy-con-joystick-drift-button\">Hall effect sticks</a> for improved longevity. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Pulse-Red-Windows-Devices/dp/B08K4HLCPR\"> Xbox Wireless Controller</a> is the best option for most folks. It makes a great PC controller, too.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#PgJQW8\">The best Xbox controller for most people</a></li><li><a href=\"#ENssks\">The best cheap Xbox controller</a></li><li><a href=\"#IbgeAd\">The best “pro” Xbox controller</a></li><li><a href=\"#qMubJZ\">A formidable alternative to the Elite</a></li><li><a href=\"#8bTkJx\">Other controllers worth knowing about</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But while the default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, there are several alternatives worth considering.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"sDLe4k\">What we’re looking for</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"TNEUMp\"><strong>Connectivity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it wireless?

It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of over 20 years of Xbox gamepads, and it shows.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, this is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there. (Third-party wireless options have been trickling out in recent years, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox Wireless Controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C connection.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23516624/adbenedetto_220508_5192_0036.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Two Xbox controllers, one blue and one black, being held by wooden mannequin hands.\" title=\"Two Xbox controllers, one blue and one black, being held by wooden mannequin hands.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The standard Xbox controller looks great, feels great, plays great, and is available in cool colors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Antonio G.

Di Benedetto / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\" /></figure>\n\n<p>But the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $60 asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you may be better served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like<a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/hori-pad-pro-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-one/-/A-86501139\"> Hori’s Horipad Pro</a> — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.</p>\n\n<p>The only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity, though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its<a href=\"https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/configure/xbox-wireless-controller\"> Xbox Design Lab</a>, which bumps the price from $69.99 to $109.93 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors Microsoft offers.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ENssks\">The best cheap Xbox controller</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>Two / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> Wired</em></em></p>\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a great controller but don’t have a lot of money to spend — and you don’t mind a cable — PowerA’s <a href=\"https://www.powera.com/p/xbox/xbox-series-xs/controllers/wired/advantage-wired-controller-for-xbox-red-xbgp0166-01/\">Advantage Wired Controller</a> offers a solid value without much sacrifice. Its full retail price is $37.99, but some color schemes dip as low as $25. The Advantage is PowerA’s follow-up to its Enhanced Wired Controller, our previous budget pick. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23171609/powera-enhanced-wired-controller-pastel-xbox-hands-on-impressions-photos\">Like the Enhanced</a>, the Advantage comes in a wide variety of hues and designs, but it has some nice improvements. Namely, the new model has a detachable USB-C cable (instead of micro-USB) and three-way hair-trigger lockouts. It also has two customizable rear buttons like the Enhanced, rounding out a nice arsenal of features for a low-cost gamepad.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799812/5192_PowerA_Advantage_Controller_Xbox_ADiBenedetto_0002.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;You don’t normally find a feature like hair-trigger lockouts on a controller this affordable.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge\" />\n<p>The only other thing I’d love to see in a controller this cheap are drift-free Hall effect sticks. If that’s a priority to you while on a tight budget, consider spending a little more on the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23799149/gamesir-g7-se-xbox-windows-hall-effect-drift-free-controller-price\">GameSir G7 SE</a>. It’s another great USB-C wired option that puts the drift worries to bed <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-Controller-Xbox-Windows-Joysticks-X/dp/B0C7GW9F88\">for around $40</a>, though it doesn’t have trigger lockouts like the Advantage does.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"IbgeAd\">The best “pro” Xbox controller</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>Up to four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features\"> Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> is Microsoft’s fancy controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and it just <em>feels </em>nice in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $179.99. There’s also the stripped-down <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340603/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-white-controller-release-date-price\">Elite Series 2 “Core” version</a> with an MSRP of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BTTT8W7J\">$129.99</a>, which ditches the add-ons. You can buy them separately in <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/complete-component-pack\">a $59.99 accessories pack</a>, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.</p>\n\n<p>A pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of an emotional purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels, but it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your likings, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc. while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool as when using an Elite. (And why try to get good or learn something when I can buy my way there instead?)</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-1 wp-block-gallery-3 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23516635/adbenedetto_220508_5192_0047.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"A close-up of the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, showing its matte black finish.\" title=\"A close-up of the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, showing its matte black finish.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Elite Series 2 is made from premium materials but has a nice, subdued aesthetic.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Antonio G.

Di Benedetto / The Verge\" /></figure>\n\n<p>While the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517317/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-hardware-issues-warranty\"> extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year</a> in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained\">stick drift</a> after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Even with those heaping mouthfuls of salt, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"UwyahT\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features\">Read our Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"qMubJZ\">A formidable alternative to the Elite</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></em></p>\n\n<p>At $199.99, <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro/RZ06-05200100-R3U1\">Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro</a> controller is even more expensive than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the added cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, with a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours). Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25799874/247446_Razer_Wolverine_V3_Pro_ADiBenedetto_0002.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The V3 Pro has four angled rear buttons and two extra shoulder buttons.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Antonio G.

And if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Tournament-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6QT8K6\">Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition</a> that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired version.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"8bTkJx\">Other controllers worth knowing about</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.newegg.com/p/3EF-000S-00006\">Nacon’s Revolution X</a> is one of the most customizable wired controllers you can get (it even has removable weights in its handles), and its software is nearly as expansive as Microsoft’s first-party app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turtle Beach’s controllers have offerings with handy audio features geared toward competitive shooters, like the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Officially-Licensed-Xbox-Windows-X/dp/B096GQBLM2\">Recon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Turtle-Beach-REACT-R-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B64GRYJ9\">React-R</a>. Its fanciest option, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S\">Stealth Ultra</a>, is a $200 wireless model with Hall effect sticks that’s overall very good. Though, for the same money, I prefer the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, since it feels better to use and the Stealth Ultra’s built-in 1.5-inch screen for customizing functions (or getting social media notifications) is clunky.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09V62CDKX/\">8BitDo’s Ultimate Wired Controller</a> for Xbox and PC is a quality, affordable gamepad with two rear buttons and software customization, though the lengthy USB cable is not detachable. There’s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSP5BB7Y/?th=1\">a new model with Hall effect sticks</a> and a detachable USB-C cable that looks like a real contender. It’s on our shortlist of options to test next alongside the <a href=\"https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-c-wired-controller-xbox/\">8BitDo Ultimate C</a>, which has RGB analog stick rings but lacks rear buttons, and the <a href=\"https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-3-mode-controller-xbox/\">8BitDo Ultimate 3-Mode</a>, which is wired on Xbox but includes wireless connectivity for PC and mobile.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Briefly mentioned above, the<a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/hori-pad-pro-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-one/-/A-86501139\"> Horipad Pro</a> has one of the best D-pads around. It also offers a lot of software customization at an affordable price, but its shoulder buttons are a bit stiff.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re the nostalgic type, the <a href=\"https://howl.me/cmZaYoudRTm\">Hyperkin Duke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-DuchesS-Wired-Controller-Officially-Console/dp/B0D9638Z3J\">DuchesS</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Xenon-Controller-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C5DZHCY9\">Xenon</a> are faithful wired recreations of Xbox gamepads from Microsoft’s first two console generations. They’re kind of dumb but endearing (especially the chunky Duke), but they’re unique collector pieces you can also use on modern games.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We’re planning to test PowerA’s newest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the <a href=\"https://www.powera.com/p/fusion/controllers/wired/fusion-pro-4-wired-controller-for-xbox-xbgp0325-01/\">Fusion Pro 4 Wired</a> and <a href=\"https://www.powera.com/p/fusion/controllers/wireless/fusion-pro-wireless-controller-for-xbox-with-lumectra-xbgp0278-01/\">PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless</a>. The former is primarily standard fare for a pro-style controller these days, but it does come with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks. It also features remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. The Fusion Pro Wireless is similar but offers some trippy Lumectra lighting, letting you customize four separate RGB zones with six different lighting modes.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We’d be remiss not to give the wireless <a href=\"https://www.turtlebeach.com/products/stealth-pivot-controller\">Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot</a> a spin (pun intended). The customizable controller uses a unique swivel system that allows you to quickly swap the analog sticks for additional face buttons, which makes it ideal for fighting game purists and other retro gaming needs. We plan on getting our hands on one in the coming weeks, so we’ll let you know whether it’s the next best thing or just a fun party trick.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

If you play on an Xbox Series X or Series S (or a Windows PC), you can choose between several high-quality controllers from Microsoft as well as a plethora of great options from the likes of 8BitDo, PowerA, Razer, Scuf, Nacon, and Turtle Beach, some of which have even started using drift-proof Hall effect sticks for improved longevity. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.\nI’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may not be a surprise that the standard Xbox Wireless Controller is the best option for most folks. It makes a great PC controller, too.\n \n\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nOther controllers worth knowing about\n\nBut while the default Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, there are several alternatives worth considering.\nWhat we’re looking for\nConnectivity\nIs it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable?\nQuality\nDoes it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing?\nExtra features\nDoes it have handy extras like remappable extra buttons or fancy triggers?\nCustomization\nCan you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles? Is there a fun cosmetic flair to its design?\nValue\nIs it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Xbox controller for most people\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: No / Software customization: No / Power: AA batteries or add-on rechargeable\nOkay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this standard controller truly does earn this title as the best all-rounder. It lacks some extras found on pricier options, but this controller is the distillation of over 20 years of Xbox gamepads, and it shows.\nThanks to Microsoft’s proprietary wireless protocol, this is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there. (Third-party wireless options have been trickling out in recent years, but they’re mostly at the high end.) While some hate the standard Xbox Wireless Controller for its use of AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. And user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use. It also works over a USB-C connection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $60 asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you may be better served by a dedicated fight stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with a superb D-pad like Hori’s Horipad Pro — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is an extraordinary jack-of-all-trades.\nThe only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity, though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its Xbox Design Lab, which bumps the price from $69.99 to $109.93 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick one from the many colors Microsoft offers.\nThe best cheap Xbox controller\nConnectivity: Wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Two / Software customization: No / Power: Wired\nIf you’re looking for a great controller but don’t have a lot of money to spend — and you don’t mind a cable — PowerA’s Advantage Wired Controller offers a solid value without much sacrifice. Its full retail price is $37.99, but some color schemes dip as low as $25. The Advantage is PowerA’s follow-up to its Enhanced Wired Controller, our previous budget pick. Like the Enhanced, the Advantage comes in a wide variety of hues and designs, but it has some nice improvements. Namely, the new model has a detachable USB-C cable (instead of micro-USB) and three-way hair-trigger lockouts. It also has two customizable rear buttons like the Enhanced, rounding out a nice arsenal of features for a low-cost gamepad.\nThe only other thing I’d love to see in a controller this cheap are drift-free Hall effect sticks. If that’s a priority to you while on a tight budget, consider spending a little more on the GameSir G7 SE. It’s another great USB-C wired option that puts the drift worries to bed for around $40, though it doesn’t have trigger lockouts like the Advantage does.\nThe best “pro” Xbox controller\nConnectivity: Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Up to four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is Microsoft’s fancy controller, and it’s got a lot of nice extras, like better build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, a built-in rechargeable battery, and loads of software customization. Where the standard Xbox controller is constructed entirely of unassuming plastic, the Elite mixes higher quality soft-touch plastic, rubberized grips, and metallic touches for a superior fit and finish. This makes it heftier than the stock controller, and it just feels nice in your hands. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging, completing a really nice package for $179.99. There’s also the stripped-down Elite Series 2 “Core” version with an MSRP of $129.99, which ditches the add-ons. You can buy them separately in a $59.99 accessories pack, but you’ll end up paying more that way, barring sales or discounts.\nA pricey controller like an Xbox Elite is a bit of an emotional purchase. Most of us are not competing at e-sports levels, but it’s fun to use something that feels nicer, offers ways to custom-tailor it to your likings, and maybe gives you a slight competitive edge thanks to features like hair triggers and removable rear paddles. In theory, you may be able to get shots off faster in an online shooter with the hair triggers, and you can map the paddles to functions like jump, crouch, reload, etc. while keeping your thumb on the right stick. You could teach yourself claw grip to accomplish the latter with even a cheap wired controller, sure, but it just won’t feel as cool as when using an Elite. (And why try to get good or learn something when I can buy my way there instead?)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the Elite is still a great controller in 2025, you should keep in mind that it’s been around since 2019 and a Series 3 revision is feeling long overdue. The Series 2 also has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control — with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. It also predates the current-gen implementation of a dedicated Share button, and its potentiometer-based sticks run the risk of stick drift after long-term use (something third parties are addressing with controllers that use drift-free Hall effect sticks, unlike all three big console manufacturers). \nEven with those heaping mouthfuls of salt, the Elite 2 remains by far the most well-rounded option for a step-up Xbox controller — thanks in large part to its impressive build and expansive software experience. If all these caveats give you pause, though, there is another promising option.\nRead our Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review.\nA formidable alternative to the Elite\nConnectivity: Wireless USB dongle (Xbox / PC), wired / Connector type: USB-C / Mappable rear buttons: Four / Software customization: Yes / Power: Built-in rechargeable\nAt $199.99, Razer’s Wolverine V3 Pro controller is even more expensive than the Elite Series 2, but it’s worth the added cost if you want a high-end controller with drift-free sticks. Not only is the V3 Pro Razer’s first foray into using Hall effect sticks, it’s the company’s first fully wireless Xbox gamepad. It also sports some of the best hair-trigger lockouts around, with a mouse-like click usually found on even pricier Scuf controllers (a previous high-ranking pick of ours). Other than that, the V3 Pro is similar to the previous V2 Pro, with six remappable buttons — four rear paddles in new, angled orientations and two extra shoulder buttons — and some RGB lighting. The buttons and D-pad still have that satisfying micro-switch tactility and audible clickiness like the previous-gen V2 Pro, but the RGB lighting is more subtle this time around.\n\n\n\n\nThe Wolverine V3 Pro’s biggest shortcomings compared to Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 are its  more basic software customization, lack of Bluetooth, and the fact that it needs a USB dongle to work wirelessly. The V3 Pro is otherwise the better pick if you can justify its very high cost. And if you can’t, there’s also the $99.99 Wolverine V3 Pro Tournament Edition that has a nearly identical set of features in a wired version.\nOther controllers worth knowing about\nNacon’s Revolution X is one of the most customizable wired controllers you can get (it even has removable weights in its handles), and its software is nearly as expansive as Microsoft’s first-party app.\nTurtle Beach’s controllers have offerings with handy audio features geared toward competitive shooters, like the Recon and React-R. Its fanciest option, the Stealth Ultra, is a $200 wireless model with Hall effect sticks that’s overall very good. Though, for the same money, I prefer the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, since it feels better to use and the Stealth Ultra’s built-in 1.5-inch screen for customizing functions (or getting social media notifications) is clunky.\n8BitDo’s Ultimate Wired Controller for Xbox and PC is a quality, affordable gamepad with two rear buttons and software customization, though the lengthy USB cable is not detachable. There’s a new model with Hall effect sticks and a detachable USB-C cable that looks like a real contender. It’s on our shortlist of options to test next alongside the 8BitDo Ultimate C, which has RGB analog stick rings but lacks rear buttons, and the 8BitDo Ultimate 3-Mode, which is wired on Xbox but includes wireless connectivity for PC and mobile.\nBriefly mentioned above, the Horipad Pro has one of the best D-pads around. It also offers a lot of software customization at an affordable price, but its shoulder buttons are a bit stiff.\nIf you’re the nostalgic type, the Hyperkin Duke, DuchesS, and Xenon are faithful wired recreations of Xbox gamepads from Microsoft’s first two console generations. They’re kind of dumb but endearing (especially the chunky Duke), but they’re unique collector pieces you can also use on modern games.\nWe’re planning to test PowerA’s newest pro-style Xbox controllers, including the Fusion Pro 4 Wired and PowerA Fusion Pro Wireless. The former is primarily standard fare for a pro-style controller these days, but it does come with height-adjustable Hall effect sticks. It also features remappable rear buttons, three-way trigger locks, and onboard volume controls. The Fusion Pro Wireless is similar but offers some trippy Lumectra lighting, letting you customize four separate RGB zones with six different lighting modes.\nWe’d be remiss not to give the wireless Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot a spin (pun intended). The customizable controller uses a unique swivel system that allows you to quickly swap the analog sticks for additional face buttons, which makes it ideal for fighting game purists and other retro gaming needs. We plan on getting our hands on one in the coming weeks, so we’ll let you know whether it’s the next best thing or just a fun party trick.\nPhotography by Antonio G.
