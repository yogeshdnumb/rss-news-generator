This was before smartphones, when you had to have international calling cards, and my family had only gotten high-speed internet access the year before.

All of my high school friends were on it, and it was cheaper than calling my family with expensive international minutes. The call quality wasn’t always great, and the time difference between Tokyo and New York City was tough. But in those early days, it was comforting to set up Skype dates with people who I knew loved me. That distinctive Skype ringtone was a reminder that I could always go home if I wanted to. Nearly a decade later, when my dad had to leave the US to receive more affordable medical treatment in Korea, Skype was the only video chat software he knew how to use. It became the main way I could see him for several months before his health declined. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Eventually, we all moved on to other chat and video apps. My Japanese friends all use LINE, and my Korean family all uses KakaoTalk. FaceTime, Zoom, and Google Meet pretty much cover the rest of my friends. I haven’t thought of Skype in a hot second.

That makes it easier to understand why the PP-1 has a €5,800 (around $6,012) price tag.\nAlthough companies like ELP of Japan sell turntables that swap needles and tonearms for laser pickups, the PP-1 does feature more traditional record player hardware. The studio worked with a company called Miniot that created a similarly minimal turntable lacking a visible tonearm. Waiting for Ideas adapted Miniot’s technology so that the PP-1’s inverted cartridge and stylus are hidden behind a closing door system and kept out of sight when there’s no record sitting on its platter.\nThere’s also no speed control dial on the PP-1. Miniot’s technology can automatically detect if a record needs to be played at 33 or 45 RPM, and constantly recalculates the speed of the motor to ensure optimal playback at all times.\nIt’s not only a striking piece of design, it’s also a high-quality turntable. But if you’re a vinyl enthusiast, you’ll need to remember to place your records upside down on the PP-1 to hear the tracks you want.\nPower is supplied by a single 5V USB-C port, and the PP-1 features just a single 3.5-millimeter audio jack for connecting it to either active or passive speakers that require an additional amplifier.\nIf you’re looking for a complete sound system, Waiting For Ideas has also created a set of passive 85-decibel 80W speakers matching the dimensions of the PP-1. They’re now available for preorder for €3,200 (around $3,320) and will take 12 weeks to make. You’ll just need to budget for a separate amplifier because the studio unfortunately doesn’t make a matching one of those.","summary":"A Paris-based creative studio has announced a minimalist turntable with controls streamlined to just a play button and a volume knob. Waiting For Ideas’ PP-1 — short for Plug and Play — doesn’t even have a visible tonearm, and it’s made from a solid block of anodized aluminum requiring about 12 weeks of production time [&#8230;]","id":"https://www.theverge.com/?p=621863","isoDate":"2025-02-28T20:30:58.000Z"},{"title":"Tesla Superchargers coming to dozens of Steak ‘n Shake locations","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/621810/tesla-supercharger-steak-n-shake-partnership","pubDate":"2025-02-28T19:31:25.000Z","author":"Andrew J.
