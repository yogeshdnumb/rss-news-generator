Given the extent of the code available, mods could include the kinds of modern updates, like higher and wider resolutions or beefed-up textures and refresh rates, that all good games deserve.\nBuilding and working with this code will not be a plug-and-play affair. The namesake 1995 game and its hugely popular 1996 Red Alert sequel require some older dependencies, like DirectX 5 and the Greenleaf Communications Library (for a full build and tool access) and the Borland Turbo Assembler (TASM 4.0) to compile. Renegade and Generals, however, call for a whole lot more nostalgia: STLport 4.5.3, the SafeDisk API, the GameSpy SDK, the RAD Miles Sound System SDK, and at least eight more.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kevin Purdy\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/command-conquer-source-release-promises-more-mods-and-updates-for-rts-legend/#comments","content":"\n            With the right folks involved, EA can capably preserve and update its classics.\n          ","contentSnippet":"With the right folks involved, EA can capably preserve and update its classics.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/command-conquer-source-release-promises-more-mods-and-updates-for-rts-legend/","categories":["Gaming","Command & Conquer","EA","Electronic Arts","real time strategy","source code"],"isoDate":"2025-02-28T17:05:46.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","title":"Europol arrests 25 users of online network accused of sharing AI CSAM","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/25-arrested-so-far-for-sharing-ai-sex-images-of-minors-in-largest-eu-crackdown/","pubDate":"Fri, 28 Feb 2025 16:45:46 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Europe is cracking down on AI-generated sex images of minors.
