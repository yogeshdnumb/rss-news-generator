In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention.

Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of <em>Verge</em>-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-roborock-deals\">The best Roborock deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Roborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra</strong> — our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — <strong>is available from <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-flexiarm-design-side-brush-10000-pa-suction-and-8-in-1-rockdock-ultra-white/6579466.p\">Best Buy</a>, <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-maxv-ultra/\">Roborock</a>, and <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQLPNB2X\">Amazon</a> (for Prime members)</strong> for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date.</strong> The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. That said, it’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23531209/roborock-s8-pro-robot-vacuums-price-specs-release-date-ces\"><strong>Roborock S8 Pro Ultra</strong></a>, which is almost identical to the aforementioned S8 MaxV, is currently matching its all-time low of $899.99 ($700 off) at <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-pro-ultra/\">Roborock’s online storefront</a>. The main difference is that the Ultra lacks an RGB camera, meaning it isn’t as good at avoiding obstacles, but that might be a positive if you prioritize privacy. It’s also limited to 8,000Pa of suction power and lacks a built-in voice assistant, as well as support for Matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Roborock S8 Plus</strong> is another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s available for $549.99 ($450 off) — its second-best price to date — from <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-plus/\">Roborock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-S8-Self-Empty-Ultrasonic-Detection/dp/B0BVB45FHV?th=1\">Amazon</a>, if you’re a Prime member. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It’s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space.</p>\n\n<p>The big-wheeled <strong>Roborock Q5 Pro</strong> is down to<strong> $179.99 ($250 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Q5-Pro-DuoRoller-Navigation/dp/B0C7VLHMQR\">Amazon</a> thanks to an on-page coupon, which is $40 more than its lowest price to date. </strong>Not only is it one of the most affordable robovacs you can buy, but thanks to its dual rubber roller brushes and 5,500Pa of suction power, the entry-level Roborock model remains one of the best we’ve found at dealing with unwanted pet hair.</p>\n\n<p>The lidar-mapping Q5 Pro features voice controls, digital keep-out zones, and mopping pads with an onboard reservoir, but no self-cleaning functions. This particular SKU doesn’t include a self-emptying base, but the 770ml dust bin is one of the largest you’ll find, so you can go a few weeks without touching it. <strong>That said, Roborock sells a version with a self-emptying dock, which is available right now for $479.99 ($220 off) directly from <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-q5-pro-plus-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-auto-empty-dock\">Roborock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Roborock-Q5-Pro-Robot-Vacuum-and-Mop-with-Auto-Empty-Dock-770ml-Large-Dustbin-for-Pet-Hair/5112035648\">Walmart</a>.</strong></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KkTLAn\">The best Dreame deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Dreame X40 Ultra</strong> is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for <strong>$949.99 ($550 off) — $50 shy of its all-time low — from <strong><a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/dreametech-x40-ultra-robot-vacuum\">Dreame</a></strong></strong> <strong>and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0CXDXKSXP\">Amazon</a> (if you’re a Prime member).</strong> You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.</p>\n\n<p>The Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Dream L20 Ultra</strong> is available for<strong> an all-time low of $549.98 ($450 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT\">Amazon</a> and directly from <a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/l20-ultra\">Dreame</a> when you use promo code EOL20U.</strong> The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-switchbot-deals\">The best SwitchBot deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>SwitchBot S10</strong> is on sale <strong>for $413.99 ($786 off), which is $23 shy of its all-time low price, when you check out at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Stations-Draining-Refilling-Hands-Free/dp/B0CSNB6TF8/\">Amazon</a>.</strong> The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.</p>\n\n<p>The S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125273/switchbot-robot-vacuum-matter-support\">robovacs with Matter support</a>, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5ticpp\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">Read our SwitchBot S10 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>SwitchBot K10 Plus</strong> is also available for an all-time low of $199.99 ($200 off) directly from <a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-mini-robot-vacuum-k10/\">SwitchBot</a> with promo code LMTM120. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well.

The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry.

It does a good job of picking up dirt and debris, and with a 120-minute runtime, it won’t run out of juice as quickly as other models in its price range. Its hybrid roller brush, which combines bristle and plastic, also helps reduce unwanted tangling, which happens more frequently with standard bristle brushes. While the Ion doesn’t come with advanced features like mapping, it’s another good option if you’re looking for a no-frills robovac that’ll get the job done on a shoestring budget.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"other-robot-vacuum-deals\">Other robot vacuum deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, April 17th: </strong>Updated to reflect current price/availability and several new deals, including those for the Eufy 11S Max and Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"A number of excellent models are on sale right now, including the Dreame L20 Ultra. | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nWe’re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it’s a self-driving car or a robot that can clean on your behalf. Most of us probably won’t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.\nToday’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we’ll even have models that can pick up dirty laundry and purify the air in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Roborock deals\nThe best Dreame deals\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nThe best Eufy deals\nThe best Yeedi deals\nThe best Shark deals\nOther robot vacuum deals\n\nBut if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of Verge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or a top-of-the-line offering from iRobot, Dreame, and more.\nThe best Roborock deals\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra — our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — is available from Best Buy, Roborock, and Amazon (for Prime members) for $1,299.99 ($500 off), which is $200 shy of its best price to date. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. That said, it’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.\nThe Roborock S8 Pro Ultra, which is almost identical to the aforementioned S8 MaxV, is currently matching its all-time low of $899.99 ($700 off) at Roborock’s online storefront. The main difference is that the Ultra lacks an RGB camera, meaning it isn’t as good at avoiding obstacles, but that might be a positive if you prioritize privacy. It’s also limited to 8,000Pa of suction power and lacks a built-in voice assistant, as well as support for Matter.\nThe Roborock S8 Plus is another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s available for $549.99 ($450 off) — its second-best price to date — from Roborock and Amazon, if you’re a Prime member. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It’s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space.\nThe big-wheeled Roborock Q5 Pro is down to $179.99 ($250 off) at Amazon thanks to an on-page coupon, which is $40 more than its lowest price to date. Not only is it one of the most affordable robovacs you can buy, but thanks to its dual rubber roller brushes and 5,500Pa of suction power, the entry-level Roborock model remains one of the best we’ve found at dealing with unwanted pet hair.\nThe lidar-mapping Q5 Pro features voice controls, digital keep-out zones, and mopping pads with an onboard reservoir, but no self-cleaning functions. This particular SKU doesn’t include a self-emptying base, but the 770ml dust bin is one of the largest you’ll find, so you can go a few weeks without touching it. That said, Roborock sells a version with a self-emptying dock, which is available right now for $479.99 ($220 off) directly from Roborock and Walmart.\nThe best Dreame deals\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $949.99 ($550 off) — $50 shy of its all-time low — from Dreame and Amazon (if you’re a Prime member). You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.\nThe Dream L20 Ultra is available for an all-time low of $549.98 ($450 off) at Amazon and directly from Dreame when you use promo code EOL20U. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.\nThe L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nThe SwitchBot S10 is on sale for $413.99 ($786 off), which is $23 shy of its all-time low price, when you check out at Amazon. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.\nThe S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few robovacs with Matter support, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).\nRead our SwitchBot S10 review.\nThe SwitchBot K10 Plus is also available for an all-time low of $199.99 ($200 off) directly from SwitchBot with promo code LMTM120. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though their mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.\nThe best Eufy deals\nThe Eufy X10 Pro Omni, our current pick for the best midrange robot vacuum / mop, is now available at Amazon for Prime members for $699.99 ($100 off), which is about $150 shy of the all-time low we last saw during Amazon’s Big Spring Sale. You can also grab it directly from Eufy for the same price when you use promo code WS24T2351121 at checkout.\nThe X10 Pro Omni is a bit of a novelty, at least in comparison to other robovacs in its price range, in that it offers AI-powered obstacle detection, which allows it to deftly navigate cables and other clutter. It also features a slew of functions you’d expect from top-of-the-line models, including 8,000Pa of suction power, speedy lidar-powered mapping, and oscillating dual spinning brushes for mopping.\nMind you, none of these features are as effective as they are on more premium models, though the result is an all-in-one bot that punches above its weight. Plus, it has heated mop drying and onboard water reservoir, the latter of which prevents it from having to return to its multifunction auto-empty / wash / fill dock too frequently.\nIf you’re looking for a bump-and-roll model that’s relatively budget-friendly, the Eufy 11S Max is on sale at Eufy’s online storefront through April 20th for just $159.99 ($90 off) thanks to coupon code WS24T2126111. The 11S Max stands out from other robovacs because it doesn’t use Wi-Fi, meaning it doesn’t require you to fiddle with a mobile app on your phone.

It’s a quiet and reliable, too, with 2,000Pa of suction power and replaceable parts, making it a great long-term investment for those who want something basic.\nThe best Yeedi deals\nThe Yeedi Cube is currently down to an all-time low of $259.99 ($230 off) at Amazon for Prime members. It’s not easy to find a self-emptying / self-cleaning vacuum at this price, as those features are typically only available on robots that cost upward of $600 or more.\nWith 5,100Pa of suction power, the Cube can tackle most common vacuuming scenarios, though its single hybrid rubber / bristle brush can get easily tangled with pet hair.

It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.\nThe best Shark deals\nThe Shark Matrix Plus 2-in-1 is a great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s now on sale for an all-time low of $399.99 ($300 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and directly from Shark. Before the Eufy X10 Pro Omni took its place, the Matrix Plus 2-in-1 was our runner-up pick for those seeking a midrange robot vacuum that mops and automatically empties its own bin. Its vibrating, sonic mopping feature does an excellent job of scrubbing hardwood floors; however, keep in mind that you’ll have to fill and attach the mop reservoir manually.\nThe Shark Ion is an a solid bump-and-roll bot that’s currently on sale for $149.99 ($80 off) at Amazon, which is one of its better prices to date. It does a good job of picking up dirt and debris, and with a 120-minute runtime, it won’t run out of juice as quickly as other models in its price range.

While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/15/24177306/apple-foldable-phone-ipados-18\">Imagine</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is.

Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising.

I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That’s the <em>regular</em> S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/257552_Samsung_Galaxy_S25_review_AJohnson_0005.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.752607989199,100,78.494784021602\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit <em>much</em>, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"oV1Wae\">The best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / <strong>Processor:</strong> Snapdragon 8 Elite / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>6,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 80W wired, 50W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP6</em>8 and IP69</em></p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/257469_OnePlus_13_AJohnson_0003.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;This vegan leather back panel is so nice.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge&nbsp;— and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"wTR5JS\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24336534/oneplus-13-review-specs-screen-camera-battery\">Read my full OnePlus 13 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"SbewYq\">The best foldable phone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>8.0-inch 2076p 120Hz OLED inner screen, 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED cover screen / <strong>Processor:</strong> Tensor G4 / <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen), 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,650mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / <strong>Weather resistance:</strong> IPX8</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Does anyone truly need a folding phone? Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen.</p>\n\n<p>The 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25607218/DSC08201_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in porcelain.\" title=\"Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in porcelain.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The inner screen is great and all, but how about that outer screen?&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>That said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow.

While iPhone owners have a smaller pool of new devices to pick from when it’s time to upgrade, there’s a wider range of choices on Android. Some Android phones even fold in half! Imagine.\nOn the flip side, all that choice can make for some hard decisions. Here’s where I’d like to help; I’ve tested a whole boatload of recent Android phones, and I think there are some real winners in the current batch. It’s all a matter of what you’re looking for, what you’re comfortable spending, and what your definition of a “reasonably sized phone” is. (I have my own, personally.)\nAs you sift through the options, you’ll almost certainly come across tech’s favorite buzzphrase of the moment: AI. Generally speaking, AI has yet to really impress me on a phone. The Pixel 9 series has some potentially useful features, like a Screenshots app that uses AI to tag relevant info in metadata, and Galaxy devices can translate a phone call for you in real time. These things are nothing to sneeze at! But none of it feels like the platform shift that the big tech companies keep promising. Best not to put too much stock in any company’s AI claims just yet.\n\n\nHow we test smartphones\nThere’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.\n\n\n\n\n\nLongevity\nA great Android phone will go the distance. I look for signs that the hardware and software will keep up for many years to come, including a strong IP rating for dust and water resistance (IP68 is preferred), durable glass panels on the front and back, and a sturdy aluminum frame rather than plastic. Samsung and Google flagships now offer seven years of OS and security updates, which as awesome. As a bare minimum three years of Android OS version upgrades is preferred, along with a total of four or five years of security updates.\n\n\n\n\n\nA great screen\nThe best Android phones have plenty of resolution to cover their large display area, which means 1440p, ideally. A fast refresh rate of at least 120Hz is preferred — animations and scrolling look super smooth at that rate — and even better if it’s variable down to 1Hz to save on battery life.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality cameras\nAny phone can take a decent photo in good lighting, but the best phone cameras can handle low light and high-contrast scenes well, too. I look for optical (most common) or sensor-shift (rare) image stabilization, which helps compensate for hand shake and enable slower shutter speeds in low light to gather more light. A telephoto lens is great to have too, though high-res sensors are starting to offer better lossless crop modes that mimic short zoom lenses well.\n\n\n\n\n\nWireless charging\nMost phones on this list offer wireless charging, though not all do.

More than ever, it’s hard to understand what Samsung means when it calls this phone “Ultra.” Still, it’s your best choice for a feature-packed Android phone — even if it’s not quite as ultra as it once was.\nRead my full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nThe best Android phone that isn’t huge\nScreen: 6.2-inch 2340 x 1080 120hz OLED / Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Cameras: 50-megapixel main with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie Battery: 4000mAh / Charging: 25W wired, 15W wireless (Qi2 Ready)   / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nMost people like a big phone, and I get that. I do. If you want a big Android phone, you have plenty of options in front of you. But some of us like a smaller phone — something that (kind of) fits in your pocket, or feels more comfortable in your hand. For us, there is but one option on Android: the Samsung Galaxy S25.\nThat’s the regular S25, not the Plus, which is a fine big phone. But the standard S25 is basically the last of its kind: a full-featured phone with a 6.2-inch screen. It’s not small, but it’s not huge, and we’ll have to take what we can get. And it’s a darn good phone that keeps up with the bigger devices in all the important ways: the battery goes all day, it comes with plenty of RAM, and it even has a real telephoto lens — not something you get on a basic, 6.1-inch phone on, say, iOS.\nThe Galaxy S25 isn’t just a good, small-ish phone by default. It’s reliable, durable, and comes with the promise of seven years of OS updates. It’s not my pick for the overall best Android phone because Samsung software can be a bit much, but if you’re comfortable in the Samsung ecosystem and you just want a phone that fits in your dang pocket, then this is the one to go with.\nThe best phone if you hate waiting for your phone to charge\nScreen: 6.82-inch 1440p 120Hz LTPO OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Elite / Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.6 main with OIS, 50-megapixel 3x telephoto with OIS, 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultrawide, 32-megapixel selfie / Battery: 6,000mAh / Charging: 80W wired, 50W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68 and IP69\nThere are plenty of good reasons to consider the OnePlus 13. It has a big, beautiful screen, and costs a hundred bucks less than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Its dust and water resistance is so strong you could practically use the phone in a hurricane without consequences. And its camera system is much improved year over year, particularly when it comes to low-light portraiture. But there’s one standout reason to consider the 13: impatience.\nThe OnePlus 13 offers enough battery stamina to get through two days of moderate use on a single charge — and that’s with plenty of power-draining features enabled, including the always-on display. If you’re thriftier with your charge, it could even go beyond that. Forgot to charge overnight? No big deal; you can probably just charge it up on night two. Charging is also relatively fast, and in the US, the phone comes with an 80W wired charger in the box. So even if you do need a midday top-off, you’ll be able to get hours of charge in a matter of minutes. No other flagship phone offers that kind of charging (or not charging) flexibility.\nRead my full OnePlus 13 review.\nThe best foldable phone\nScreen: 8.0-inch 2076p 120Hz OLED inner screen, 6.3-inch 1080p 120Hz OLED cover screen / Processor: Tensor G4 / Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.7 main with OIS, 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel selfie (cover screen), 10-megapixel inner selfie camera / Battery: 4,650mAh / Charging: 21W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather resistance: IPX8\nDoes anyone truly need a folding phone? Probably not. But using one is awfully nice, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the nicest book-style foldable I’ve used to date. It’s pricey, it’s still bulkier than a slab-style phone, and its cameras aren’t quite as nice as the other Pixel 9 Pro phones. But it’s a joy to use, both as a regular phone with the cover screen and when you unfold the big inner screen.\nThe 9 Pro Fold is Google’s second folding phone, following up the passport-shaped Pixel Fold with a format that feels much more familiar. The outer screen measures 6.3 inches on the diagonal, but more importantly, the ratio is the same as Google’s slab phones. By comparison, Samsung’s Z Fold 6 uses a taller, narrower format that feels cramped. Having used them both, I much prefer the 9 Pro Fold’s approach.\nThat said, the 9 Pro Fold isn’t without compromises. The camera system isn’t quite as good as what you get in the other 9 Pro phones. The outer screen isn’t as sharp or bright as the Pixel 9 Pro’s, either. And it’s not as durable as its slab-style counterparts — there’s no dust resistance, and you can’t get it repaired just anywhere. For $1,800, that’s an awful lot to swallow. For the adventurous early adopter, though, the 9 Pro Fold will be very rewarding.\nRead my full Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review.\nOther Android phones worth considering\nThere are many more great Android devices that weren’t covered here, and a few are worth calling out that didn’t quite make the cut for a recommendation.\nFirst off, there’s the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Samsung’s excellent clamshell-style foldable. It’s not as much fun to use as the 2024 Motorola Razr Plus — which facilitates using apps on the cover screen more easily — but Motorola’s track record for software updates isn’t great, so the Z Flip 6 is a safer bet for a flip phone. Read our review.\nThe OnePlus Open is also another good book-style foldable option. It’s thin and light, and the software includes some thoughtful approaches to multitasking — a crucial part of the folding phone experience. But it won’t be supported with software updates for as long as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Read our review.\nLast but not least, there’s the Google Pixel 9A. It comes with some small but important updates over the 8A, including more robust water resistance and a slightly bigger, brighter screen. Better yet, those improvements don’t come with a price bump. With seven years of OS updates included, that’s a strong ROI. Read our review.\nUpdate, April 17th: Removed the Google Pixel 8A in the also-consider section and replaced it with the Pixel 9A. Updated other recommendations with current pricing and availability.","summary":"The Android ecosystem is all about choice.

Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac&amp;subid1=vergedeals030724\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.</p>\n\n<p>But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"EVXzol\">The best MacBook Air deals</h2>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"pEzsTQ\">M1 MacBook Air</h3>\n\n<p>The<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\"><strong>M1 MacBook Air</strong></a> was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\">redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air</a> (which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">guide to the best laptops</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101727/apple-m1-macbook-air-laptop-walmart\">committed to keeping it around</a> for the foreseeable future and is currently <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889/\">discounting it to $649</a> ($350 off), which is $20 shy of its lowest price to date.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"3VqFgR\">M2 MacBook Air</h3>\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads.</p>\n\n<p>It does have some slight downsides, though, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191141/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2-base-model-slow-device\">slower storage in the base 256GB configuration</a> and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">best laptops</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\">M2-powered MacBook Air</a> from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-apple-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight/6602763.p\">Best Buy</a> starting at $749 ($200 off), which matches its all-time low price.

While it’s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model.</p>\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"DTHGG6\">M3 MacBook Air</h3>\n\n<p>The M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review\">M3 MacBook Air</a> to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed.

Di Benedetto\n\nApple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for newer models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro.\nPurchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.\n \n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nThe best Mac Mini deals\n\nAlthough Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products, and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM1 MacBook Air\nThe M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and in brick-and-mortar stores. But while the redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air (which has been with us for a while as well) has taken over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for non-intensive productivity work, plus it has a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been removed in our guide to the best laptops.\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $649 ($350 off), which is $20 shy of its lowest price to date.\nM2 MacBook Air\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor wasn’t as revolutionary as the M1 generation, it’s a better performer for any kind of user than the M1, including creators with demanding workloads.\nIt does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop than this one since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops.\nThe M2-powered MacBook Air from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability waning. However, you can get the 13.6-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU in select colors at Best Buy starting at $749 ($200 off), which matches its all-time low price. If you don’t mind sacrificing some memory for extra storage, you can also get the 13-inch Air with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at Best Buy for $799 ($300 off).\nIt’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15.3-inch MacBook Air M2, however. While it’s scantily in stock at some retailers for its original MSRP, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model.\nM3 MacBook Air\nThe M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13.6- and 15.3-inch variants simultaneously, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\nRight now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is available in its entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD on sale at B&H Photo in select colors starting at $999 ($100 off). You can also find the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU for $1,099 ($200 off) in select colors at Amazon. Given the $100 price difference between these two models, it’s great that you’re getting double the amount of internal storage. \nAs for the 15-inch MacBook Air M3, there are currently no deals.\nM4 MacBook Air\nAlong with an updated Mac Studio, Apple recently announced a new MacBook Air, which comes in both a 13- and 15-inch configuration with a M4 processor. Interestingly, the new Air starts at a lower price than the prior model, yet it offers slightly faster performance and twice as much base RAM at 16GB. It can also connect to two external monitors with the lid open, comes in a new sky blue color, and features the 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam from the latest MacBook Pro. There’s a lot to like.\nBoth the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Airs are currently receiving their first discounts. You can pick up the 13-inch base model with a 10-core CPU, eight-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage on sale for $949 ($50 off) at Amazon and $999 at B&H Photo. If you prefer the larger 15-inch model, the entry-level configuration with a 10-core GPU, 10-core CPU, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage is on sale for $1,165 ($35 off) at Amazon.\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October 2024, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.\nWe’re finding it challenging to spot the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock, but if you don’t need the extra overhead for multitasking, Best Buy is selling it with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD for $1,199 ($200 off). The model with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is also on sale for $1,199 ($200 off) at Best Buy, while the step-up configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is going for $1,499 ($200 off) at Best Buy.\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations.

Best Buy is also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,399 ($400 off).\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro in November 2024.
