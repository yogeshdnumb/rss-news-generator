But he didn’t wait until the call to announce major changes at Intel, nor did he begin his reign by laying off 20 percent of the company’s employees, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-23/intel-to-announce-plans-this-week-to-cut-more-than-20-of-staff\">as <em>Bloomberg</em> reported he might</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have not set any headcount reduction target,” Intel spokesperson Sophie Metzger tells&nbsp;<em>The Verge.</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, Tan is announcing that employees will return to the office for an additional day per week — four days in office, up from three — as the company purges what he characterizes as “unnecessary bureaucracy,” reduces the size of teams, and cuts back on “time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Intel has just published <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1738/lip-bu-tan-our-path-forward\">an all-hands memo from Tan to employees</a> detailing these and other changes; you can read it in full at the bottom of this post. The company is also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/intel/655947/did-intel-just-announce-layoffs-maybe-not-mass-layoffs\">subtly suggesting that job cuts are nigh</a>, but that they might come from Intel’s individual leaders rather than layoffs from the company as a whole.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities,” Tan writes in the memo. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it sounds like there will be pressure on those leaders to cut people, and soon:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Tan says that these workforce reductions will “begin in Q2” — which is now — “and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Intel said today it that it hopes to save an extra $0.5 billion in 2025 alone compared to previous goals, and more in 2026. As for this quarter, the company lost $0.4 billion <a href=\"https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1737/intel-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results\">in Q1 2025</a>, on flat revenue of $12.7 billion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/intels-new-ceo-plots-overhaul-manufacturing-ai-operations-2025-03-17/\"><em>Reuters</em> reported last month</a> that Tan planned to significantly change Intel’s chip manufacturing and cut “what Tan views as a slow-moving and bloated middle management layer.” That report seems to have been accurate. On the earnings call, Tan says he’s also instructed teams to find $2 billion they can save in capital expenditures.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his first public statement in March, Tan said that his Intel would be “an engineering-focused company” that would “take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog” in the future. Today, he says he’s doing that in part by flattening the organization: “All critical product and manufacturing and G&amp;A functions that were spread over 2-3 layers are now directly reporting to me,” he says on the earnings call.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made. New ideas and people who generate them have not been given the room or resources to incubate and grow. The unnecessary silos have led to bad execution. I&#8217;m here to fix this,” says Tan.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for Tan’s strategy for Intel overall, he says “it’s a bit too soon for me to provide all the details” but shared several priorities, including:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>“Start building best-in-class products again”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“A holistic approach to redefine our portfolio to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Refine our AI strategy with a focus on emerging areas of interest” </li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Our goal will be to enable the next wave of computing defined by reasoning models, agentic AI, and physical AI”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“We need to build trust with foundry customers”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Learn to delight our customers by building wafers that meet their required power, performance area, and on-time schedule”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>“Our business is capital intensive and we have important investment to make at the time when our financial performance is not where it needs to be. This means we need to be prudent with capital.”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Intel’s all-important 18A process, which was supposed to mark the company’s return to silicon process leadership, is still going into “volume production” in the second half of 2025, but don’t expect a full complement of laptops built on Intel’s Panther Lake silicon at once. Intel says it’ll launch its first Panther Lake chip for power users by the end of the year, but additional chips will come in Q1, according to Intel Products chief Michelle Johnston Holthaus.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of Intel’s chips may also cost more due to tariffs, though, and Intel’s bracing for people to potentially buy fewer computers as a result. “While we have offsets, including a global, highly diversified manufacturing footprint to help mitigate tariffs, we will certainly see costs increase and we feel it prudent to anticipate a TAM contraction,” Intel CFO David Zinsner says on the call. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, Holthaus says Panther Lake should be a good product from both performance and price perspectives, unlike <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285513/intel-ceo-lunar-lake-one-off-memory-package-discrete-gpu\">the too-expensive Lunar Lake</a>. She confirmed that the future Nova Lake, like Panther Lake, won’t be built entirely on Intel’s wafers but will still lean on Taiwan’s TSMC as well, but the plan is to eventually get to 70 percent manufactured in-house. Zinsner says Intel now believes it’s prudent to always have some outside manufacturing in addition to Intel’s own.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s the full memo for posterity:</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>The following note from Lip-Bu Tan was emailed to all Intel Corporation employees on April 24, 2025:</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Team,</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today we reported our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://newsroom.intel.com/corporate/intel-reports-first-quarter-2025-financial-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Q1 2025 results</a>. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Flattening the Organization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Streamlining Our Processes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Returning to the Office</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Building a New Intel</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lip-Bu Tan</p>\n</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Today is Intel’s Q1 2025 earnings call, and the first we’re truly hearing from new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over the company on March 18th. But he didn’t wait until the call to announce major changes at Intel, nor did he begin his reign by laying off 20 percent of the company’s employees, as Bloomberg reported he might. \n“We have not set any headcount reduction target,” Intel spokesperson Sophie Metzger tells The Verge.\nInstead, Tan is announcing that employees will return to the office for an additional day per week — four days in office, up from three — as the company purges what he characterizes as “unnecessary bureaucracy,” reduces the size of teams, and cuts back on “time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.”\nIntel has just published an all-hands memo from Tan to employees detailing these and other changes; you can read it in full at the bottom of this post. The company is also subtly suggesting that job cuts are nigh, but that they might come from Intel’s individual leaders rather than layoffs from the company as a whole.\n“We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities,” Tan writes in the memo. \nBut it sounds like there will be pressure on those leaders to cut people, and soon:\nI’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people.\nTan says that these workforce reductions will “begin in Q2” — which is now — “and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.”\nIntel said today it that it hopes to save an extra $0.5 billion in 2025 alone compared to previous goals, and more in 2026. As for this quarter, the company lost $0.4 billion in Q1 2025, on flat revenue of $12.7 billion.\nReuters reported last month that Tan planned to significantly change Intel’s chip manufacturing and cut “what Tan views as a slow-moving and bloated middle management layer.” That report seems to have been accurate. On the earnings call, Tan says he’s also instructed teams to find $2 billion they can save in capital expenditures.\nIn his first public statement in March, Tan said that his Intel would be “an engineering-focused company” that would “take calculated risks to disrupt and leapfrog” in the future. Today, he says he’s doing that in part by flattening the organization: “All critical product and manufacturing and G&A functions that were spread over 2-3 layers are now directly reporting to me,” he says on the earnings call.\n“Organizational complexity and bureaucracies have been suffocating the innovation and agility we need to win. It takes too long for decisions to get made. New ideas and people who generate them have not been given the room or resources to incubate and grow. The unnecessary silos have led to bad execution. I’m here to fix this,” says Tan.\nAs for Tan’s strategy for Intel overall, he says “it’s a bit too soon for me to provide all the details” but shared several priorities, including:\n“Start building best-in-class products again”\n“A holistic approach to redefine our portfolio to optimize our products for new and emerging AI workloads”\n“Refine our AI strategy with a focus on emerging areas of interest” \n“Our goal will be to enable the next wave of computing defined by reasoning models, agentic AI, and physical AI”\n“We need to build trust with foundry customers”\n“Learn to delight our customers by building wafers that meet their required power, performance area, and on-time schedule”\n“Our business is capital intensive and we have important investment to make at the time when our financial performance is not where it needs to be. This means we need to be prudent with capital.”\nMeanwhile, Intel’s all-important 18A process, which was supposed to mark the company’s return to silicon process leadership, is still going into “volume production” in the second half of 2025, but don’t expect a full complement of laptops built on Intel’s Panther Lake silicon at once.

But some people have managed to snag one using once conventional but now antiquated means: <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tech/654944/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gamestop-mario-kart-world-bundle\">going to GameStop</a> and preordering one in store.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In addition to offering online preorders for the Switch 2, its <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2\">Mario Kart World</a></em> bundle, and the various Switch 2 accessories, GameStop also allowed customers to preorder the console in person when stores opened for business on April 24th. With the advent of ecommerce, preordering video games in a brick-and-mortar store has become a quaint practice that’s fallen out of fashion; something looked upon with nostalgia for the midnight releases of years gone by. But for many people, physically preordering a Switch 2 was the best and easiest way to secure one. I should know — it’s how I got mine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I missed the midnight commencement of online Switch 2 preordering for retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. Knowing GameStop opened its online preorders at 11AM ET on April 24th, I thought I might give it a go there, but it was not to be. GameStop’s later preorder launch was just as chaotic, frustrating, and fruitless as it was for the other stores. But then I remembered <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lnkymmvwec2x\">seeing a post on Bluesky from <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier</a>. “About 40 people waiting on line here at my local GameStop for 80 Switch 2s. Better odds than the website!” he wrote. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I saw that my local GameStop on Howe Road in Akron, Ohio, opened soon, and I was no more than a 15-minute ride away. So I packed my wallet and my dog Bu and went down there only to be greeted by a line full of people, some of whom had been waiting for days.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/20250424_122604.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"Photo capturing a line of about 20 people waiting outside a Gamestop in Akron, Ohio to preorder a Switch 2\" title=\"Photo capturing a line of about 20 people waiting outside a Gamestop in Akron, Ohio to preorder a Switch 2\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The scene outside of my local Akron GameStop. | Photo: Ash Parrish / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Ash Parrish / The Verge\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s been unbelievably busy,” one GameStop employee told me. He said that people started lining up earlier in the week but he discouraged them from camping for multiple days overnight. “We had six waiting yesterday,” he said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other than that small number of campers, most people I spoke to who were waiting in line had only arrived a few hours before the store opened. Nearly everyone owned a regular Switch and was excited by the promise of an improved console.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Switch 1 is so awesome and we’ve been waiting for a Switch 2 for seven years now,” one woman at the front of the line told me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I have to upgrade, there’s no other way around it,” said another Switch 2 hopeful. Everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic about the console and when I brought up its price they still didn’t seem phased.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“That doesn&#8217;t bother me, I got more than enough money,” said one man.

But some people have managed to snag one using once conventional but now antiquated means: going to GameStop and preordering one in store. \nIn addition to offering online preorders for the Switch 2, its Mario Kart World bundle, and the various Switch 2 accessories, GameStop also allowed customers to preorder the console in person when stores opened for business on April 24th. With the advent of ecommerce, preordering video games in a brick-and-mortar store has become a quaint practice that’s fallen out of fashion; something looked upon with nostalgia for the midnight releases of years gone by. But for many people, physically preordering a Switch 2 was the best and easiest way to secure one. I should know — it’s how I got mine.\nI missed the midnight commencement of online Switch 2 preordering for retailers like Wal-Mart, Best Buy, and others. Knowing GameStop opened its online preorders at 11AM ET on April 24th, I thought I might give it a go there, but it was not to be. GameStop’s later preorder launch was just as chaotic, frustrating, and fruitless as it was for the other stores. But then I remembered seeing a post on Bluesky from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier. “About 40 people waiting on line here at my local GameStop for 80 Switch 2s. Better odds than the website!” he wrote. \nI saw that my local GameStop on Howe Road in Akron, Ohio, opened soon, and I was no more than a 15-minute ride away. So I packed my wallet and my dog Bu and went down there only to be greeted by a line full of people, some of whom had been waiting for days.\n“It’s been unbelievably busy,” one GameStop employee told me. He said that people started lining up earlier in the week but he discouraged them from camping for multiple days overnight. “We had six waiting yesterday,” he said.\nOther than that small number of campers, most people I spoke to who were waiting in line had only arrived a few hours before the store opened. Nearly everyone owned a regular Switch and was excited by the promise of an improved console. \n“The Switch 1 is so awesome and we’ve been waiting for a Switch 2 for seven years now,” one woman at the front of the line told me. \n“I have to upgrade, there’s no other way around it,” said another Switch 2 hopeful. Everyone I spoke to was enthusiastic about the console and when I brought up its price they still didn’t seem phased.\n“That doesn’t bother me, I got more than enough money,” said one man. Others mentioned the state of the US economy and with inflation impacting consumer goods across the board, the price of the Switch 2 itself seemed reasonable. “The OLED Switch when it launched was $350,” said another man. “One hundred dollars more, almost 10 years later, not that bad.”\nAnd while the price of the console doesn’t much bother this Akron crop of Switch 2 enthusiasts, the rising cost of games was another matter entirely. “The pricing for the games is a little steep for my tastes,” said the lady at the front of the line.
