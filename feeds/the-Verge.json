Yes, some bots blow hot air on their bums (mop pads), deftly navigate dog poop, and have arms to pick up your socks, but there are plenty of basic budget robot vacuums that just do a decent job of cleaning your floor autonomously — as long as you tidy up first.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Fancier models have obstacle recognition, and some even use AI-powered cameras to tell popcorn from poop and avoid the latter. If you want one of those, check out my <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner\">best robot vacuum</a> buying guide. But if you think you can manage the task of picking up after yourself (and your puppy), a budget bot will save you a lot of money and still do a good job cleaning your floor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"featured-in-this-article\">Featured in this article</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How I test robot vacuums</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">To judge its vacuuming power, I run every robot vacuum through a series of tests on hardwood and carpet, including flour, kitty litter, oatmeal, and pet and human hair. I test obstacle avoidance using cables, shoes, socks, and bed skirts. I test mopping effectiveness on hardwood and tile floors using dried and moist messes. <br><br>If the robot has an auto-empty dock, I test to see how well it empties the onboard bin as well as any other features of the dock. I run the robot vacs around three different levels in my home to see how they handle different surfaces, room transitions, and edge sensing. I evaluate how long they run before needing to recharge and test each app, focusing on its mapping functions to see how simple they are to use and how reliable they are. <br><br>I also examine each robot&#8217;s build quality and parts availability, and I totally judge them based on how much my cat Boone likes to play with them.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Price</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Yes, there are sub-$200 robots out there. No, I do not recommend you buy them. With so many new models coming out almost daily, it’s better to look for a sale on an older model from a well-known company than buy a no-name budget bot.&nbsp;<br><br>You can pick up a brand new, two-year-old Roomba or Roborock with mapping and advanced navigation for half its original price. These gadgets should last for years, so it’s not like buying last season’s Prada slip-ons.<br><br>That said, sales are hard to keep track of, so some of the prices listed here may seem high for a budget bot. If you see one that fits your needs, keep an eye on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals\">The Verge’s deals page</a> for when they go on an even better sale.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Cleaning prowess</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">The cheaper the bot, the more important suction power is, as they tend to have fewer features that improve cleaning. Higher-end robots have things like better brushes, carpet boost mode, and dirt detection.&nbsp;<br><br>At a minimum, look for 2,500Pa (if the manufacturer lists suction power; some don’t). I also much prefer rubber roller brushes or a rubber/bristle hybrid over just bristle brushes. Rubber rollers get up more dirt and get tangled less than bristles.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A mop (or not)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Bear in mind that most budget mopping bots don’t really mop — it’s more just using a damp cloth to pick up the fine dust the robot’s vacuum left behind, which is useful but not essential. Mop attachments with water reservoirs also take up space on a robot and mean a smaller bin.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A big bin</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">A big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. Eight hundred milliliters is the largest I’ve seen, but anything over 450 ml is decent on a budget bot. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots and the prevalence of auto-empty docks, it’s hard to find robots with big bins. But if you’re on a budget and don’t want to spend extra for the dock, a big bin will mean less hands-on time with your vacuum.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Or an auto-empty option</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">If you can swing it, I strongly recommend an auto-empty dock, and there are finally some cheaper versions out there. While it’s a nice-to-have rather than a must-have, delegating the chore of emptying the bin to the robot does mean your floors will be cleaner since a vacuum with a full bin won’t suck up dirt. Many standalone robots now have an auto-empty dock option you can add later if you want to wait and see, but buying them together is generally cheaper.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Navigation / mapping</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">We are starting to see true budget bots use the <a href=\"https://robotvacuums.com/blogs/blogs/a-complete-overview-of-robot-vacuum-navigation\">vSLAM (visual simultaneous localization and mapping) or lidar-powered navigation or mapping</a> found on higher-end robots, albeit lower-level versions. Some, use the bump and roll technique, with more now adding a <a href=\"https://robotvacuums.com/blogs/blogs/a-complete-overview-of-robot-vacuum-navigation#:~:text=Gyroscope%20Navigation%20in%20Robot%20Vacuums\">gyroscope function</a> that at least makes them go in a straight line.<br><br>Choosing an older version of a high-end robot will get you the better navigation, but I’ve also included a few bump-and-roll bots with basic mapping capability, which makes the experience better all around. Non-mapping bots may miss entire sections of your home and, when they start again after charging, may go over the area they last cleaned. However, mapping is less important if you want a bot for a single room or small apartment.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Good battery life / long runtime</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">While most bots can recharge and resume (go back to their charging base and refuel before going back out again), a bot that can go for at least two hours on one charge will get the job done more quickly and be less annoying. I look for at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is the best).</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A decent app</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">A lot of budget bots have barely usable apps; this is another reason why buying a lower-cost option from a company with higher-end models gets you a better experience, as the app is usually more polished.<br>A good basic app, though, should have the ability to set multiple schedules to send the robot out, an option for a do-not-disturb period (so it doesn&#8217;t start up again at 2AM because it finally recharged), and a way to link to voice assistants and smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple’s Siri.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Repairability</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Even at the budget end, you’ll be spending $200 to $300 on a robot vacuum, so repairability and the availability of replacement parts are a big bonus.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"JOucQ5\">Best budget robot vacuum&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Suction power:</strong> 5,300Pa / <em><em><strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>300ml<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Mopping option:</strong> Yes / <strong>Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ </em></em><em><em><strong>Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual / <strong>Runtime: </strong>100 mins, 2,600mAh battery/<strong> Brush style: </strong>Single rubber bristle hybrid<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you&#8217;re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/8A0A2475.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,32.547993019197,100,34.904013961606\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Tapo RV30 Max Plus includes a compact auto-empty charging dock.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Its 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it generally picked up all visible debris.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Mopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water for a good surface clean.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as three rotations.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can also set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It&#8217;s also easy to start a clean from the app, and I really like that you can tap on the map to send the robot to that spot.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally has trouble repositioning itself on its dock.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Best budget robot vacuum and mop</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Suction power:</strong> 6,000Pa <strong>/ Dustbin capacity:</strong> 400ml <strong>/&nbsp;Runtime: </strong>180 mins, 5,200mAh battery<strong> / Brush style: </strong>dual rubber <strong>/ Auto-empty dock option:</strong> yes <strong>/ Mapping:</strong> yes, lidar navigation <strong>/ Keep-out zones:</strong> yes, virtual <strong>/ Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home</em>, Siri Shortcuts</em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Roborock S8 is a great vacuum that mops well and has AI-powered obstacle detection—a rarity at this price point. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do an excellent job on hard floors and carpets, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s the option of pairing the S8 with a fairly sleek auto-empty dock, but unlike Roborock’s QRevo line (which starts at around $600), the dock won’t automatically fill the water tank or wash the mop; you’ll have to do that work manually.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Formerly a flagship robot vacuum for Roborock, this once $750 bot can now be found for well under $500, even with its auto-empty dock. Its flat mop pad vibrates 3,000 times a second to simulate some good old-fashioned scrubbing, and the bot comes with an extra-large on-board water tank, which means it actually gets wet enough to be effective.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/8A0A9244.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Roborock S8 is an excellent vacuum and great mop.

It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another great feature at this price is that the S8 has carpet sensing and can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. This bot can also raise its wheels when it cleans messes like ketchup to prevent its brushes from getting sticky.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings. The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). <span>If you want to avoid those chores, you’ll need to bump up to about $600 and get whichever&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Qrevo-Pro-Intelligent-Detection/dp/B0CQ25DFTT\">Roborock QRevo&nbsp;vac and mop is on sale.</a> This adds spinning mopping pads and an auto wash/dry/refill dock.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"best-budget-robot-vacuum-for-pet-hair\">Best budget robot vacuum for pet hair</h2>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity\" />\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Suction Power: </strong>5,000Pa / <strong>Dustbin capacity: </strong>770ml<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Self-empty dock option: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Mopping option:</strong> Yes / <strong>Mapping: </strong>Yes, lidar<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Suction power:</strong> 5,500Pa<strong> /</strong></em></em> <em><em><strong>Keep-out zones: </strong>Yes, virtual / <strong>Runtime: </strong>240 mins, 5,200mAh battery /<strong> Brush style: </strong>dual, rubber<strong> </strong>/ <strong>Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></em></p>\n\n<p>My recommendation for families with pets who don’t want to spend a small fortune on an auto-empty robot vacuum is to buy a good bot with a big bin. These are getting harder to find now that every bot wants to be a multitasker and also mop (the water reservoir takes up valuable dustbin room). So, I’m very pleased with Roborock’s Q5 Pro with its 770ml dustbin. </p>\n\n<p>This huge bin pairs with dual rubber roller brushes that are better at getting pet hair out of rugs than single brushes. The rubber is also less prone than bristles to getting tangled with hair, and combined with 5,500Pa suction power, this vacuum does a good job on very dirty floors. It does have a removable mopping pad with a small water tank built into it, too, which is useful for cleaning up the fine dust left behind by the vacuum, but it isn’t going to scrub your floors. It will, however, keep the pet hair at bay.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t confuse this with the cheaper <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-q5\">Roborock Q5</a>, however. That bot has a smaller bin, lower suction, shorter runtime, and only one roller brush. It’s worth spending the extra for the Pro.</p>\n\n<div class=\"c-image-slider alignnone wp-block-vox-media-image-slider\">\n\t<div class=\"c-image-slider__caption\">\n\t\t\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25102890/8A0A0609.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;I like big bins and I cannot lie.

The dock is relatively compact and lightweight compared to previous versions. However, considering the size of the Q5 Pro’s bin, you&#8217;d only have to empty it three times before the dock’s 2.5-liter bag is also full.</p>\n\n<p>The Q5 Pro doesn&#8217;t have AI-powered obstacle avoidance, although it will dodge shoes and larger objects. It does have a huge 5,200mAh battery that will run for about four hours. It uses the excellent Roborock app and has all the same software features of the higher-end Roborock’s family, including lidar mapping and navigation, digital keep-out zones, room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and voice control.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"T8svSv\">Best basic bump-and-roll bot</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Suction power: </strong>unknown<strong> / Dustbin capacity: </strong>425ml<strong> /&nbsp; Runtime: </strong>120 mins<strong> / Brush style: </strong>single bristle / rubber hybrid<strong> / Auto-empty dock option: </strong>no<strong> / Mapping: </strong>no<strong> / Keep-out zones: </strong>no<strong> / Works with: </strong>Amazon Alexa, Google Home</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shark-AV753-Connected-Runtime-Cleaning/dp/B08C6XGP4F?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=___vg__p_22761638__t_w__r_https://www.google.com/__d_D\">Shark Ion</a>’s big bin, simple app experience, decent battery life, repairability, and bullish nature make this an excellent bump-and-roll bot. It doesn’t map or have any special navigation features other than colliding with things and changing direction. It’s not fancy, but it gets the job done.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a good one to stick under a bed or desk and set to run when you’re not home, as it’s loud and rattly and will bang into everything in its path. But its big wheels and 120-minute runtime mean it’s less prone to getting stuck or running out of juice than simpler $200 bots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Unlike many budget bots, it uses a hybrid roller brush that’s both bristle and plastic and doesn’t get as tangled as standard bristle brushes. Its short, squat side brushes are surprisingly effective at getting debris into the robot’s path, and because they’re short, they’re less prone to getting tangled in stray cords.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24869352/236749_Robot_Vacuum_Guide_Shark_0002.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Shark has big wheels and a hybrid brush that isn’t prone to tangles.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\" />\n<p>But the best thing ‘bout this bot is its tank-like wheels that will roll right over anything in its path, including high transitions between rooms, obstacles like lounger chair legs, and other furniture traps that regularly stump other bots. That’s a good thing, as there’s no mapping, obstacle detection, or any way to set keep-out zones here. This bot just goes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Another bonus: replacement parts are easily available, making it simple to repair and just keep going.</p>\n\n<p>Shark doesn’t share suction power specs, but it ably handled all my tests, including the toughest: raw oatmeal. Those little flakes are hard to pick up; side brushes will spin them all over the floor. It did a good job on pet hair, too, although, like most robots I tested, it required at least two runs to get everything up effectively.</p>\n\n<p>The app is super basic: just on / off, scheduling, and a choice of three power levels (all loud). Disappointingly, you can only schedule it once a day. Most robots can be programmed to do two to three passes, but in place of that, I like the option to schedule it to go out twice to make sure it gets the job done. I couldn’t do that with the Shark. Still, you can press its button or use the app to send it out again if needed.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-budget-roomba-robot-vacuum\">Best budget Roomba robot vacuum</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Suction power:</strong> unknown <strong>/</strong> <strong>Dustbin capacity:</strong> 419ml<strong> /</strong> <strong>Runtime:</strong> 90 minutes <strong>/</strong> <strong>Brush style: </strong>dual rubber <strong>/</strong> <strong>Auto-empty dock option:</strong> yes <strong>/</strong> <strong>Mopping option:</strong> yes<strong> / Mapping:</strong> yes<strong> /</strong> <strong>Keep-out zones:</strong> physical only<strong> / Works with:</strong> Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Roomba i5 is the follow-up to my previous top pick for a budget robot, the Roomba i3. It’s not the cheapest bot on the block, but its cleaning chops, attractive design, good software, and robust, easily-repairable hardware make it a good choice for spending a smaller budget.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The i5 brings mopping capability to the lower end of iRobot’s line via a swappable mopping bin that adds a flat mopping pad and a sizable 210ml reservoir. There’s no carpet avoidance, though, so I had to roll up the ends of my carpets to block it from going on them. </p>\n\n<p>But this bot is best as a vacuum, and it cleans almost as well as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22880352/irobot-roomba-j7-plus-samsung-jet-bot-ai-plus-robot-vacuum-review-comparison-test\">iRobot’s higher-end j7</a> but for a lot less money. It has slightly lower suction power, but it boasts Roomba’s signature dual roller rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of removing pet hair from hardwood floors and sucking up oatmeal from plush carpets. These are slightly different from the Roborock dual brushes, and I find the nubs make them more effective at digging out the dirt, especially from carpet. </p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/IMG_3020.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The i5 can be purchased with an auto-empty dock, but like most budget bots, it just deals with the dust.&lt;/em&gt;\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p>The i5 has mapping and room-specific cleaning, so you can send it to clean the kitchen if you want. However, unlike my top pick, the Tapo RV30, there’s no option to set virtual keep-out zones.

It also has a relatively small bin, but you can pair it with <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Self-Emptying-Mapping-Personalized-Cleaning/dp/B0C4N37V2Z\">an auto-empty base</a> (although that doubles the cost).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The i5 is a solid vacuum with big wheels and a big bumper that can easily tackle any floor surface you throw at it. It can manage most transitions and is one of the only vacs I’ve tested that doesn’t get stuck on the uneven wooden floors in my screened-in porch. It does tend to bump into things, but it gets almost everywhere you want it to and won’t be put off by a bed skirt. But if you have delicate items on rickety tables, watch out.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/IMG_3032.jpeg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,15.095986038394,100,69.808027923211\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The i5 Combo comes with swappable bins, one for mopping and vacuuming and one for just vacuuming.

There’s not even an app. Instead, you just press the button, and off it trundles. It also comes with a remote if you&#8217;d rather not get up off the couch, and you can use that to program it to clean at a specific time. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 11S is super slim, 72.5 mm high, with no lidar tower, so it will get under most couches and very quiet. It has a big 600ml bin, and I was very impressed with how much it got up off my hardwood floors, even with its relatively small 2,000Pa of suction. There are three cleaning levels, and at the lowest, it registers around 55db, quiet enough to run in a home office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It does have a smallish battery — only 100 minutes of runtime — but it will go back and recharge. For $200, this is the perfect budget bot for those wary of or who don’t want to deal with an app and Wi-Fi. It’s a bump-and-roll bot, meaning there are no real navigation skills.

This means it can automatically fill its onboard water tank, clean and dry its mop, and empty the bin. It also has more advanced obstacle avoidance tech than most budget bots, although, unlike the pricier bots, it uses lasers to see objects, not an AI-powered camera, which is less effective. While it originally retailed for $699.99, it’s now an older model and is regularly on sale for less than $500.</p>\n\n<p>The Yeedi resembles the Shark and Roomba in its full-speed-ahead nature. It will just run into things, and if it can clean them, great! It also only goes around larger objects.

It scrubs the floor using a thin microfiber cloth that vibrates 2,500 times a minute to get up grime. The dock cleans the mopping pad, drains the dirty water, and auto empties the bin, but the robot carries its one-liter water tank around on its back, so it doesn’t need to go back and refill during a run.</p>\n\n<p>One downside is that it uses a single hybrid rubber / bristle brush, which gets tangled with hair.

An onboard spot clean button means you don’t need to fuss with the app to get it to clean up a dedicated area.

Yes, some bots blow hot air on their bums (mop pads), deftly navigate dog poop, and have arms to pick up your socks, but there are plenty of basic budget robot vacuums that just do a decent job of cleaning your floor autonomously — as long as you tidy up first.\nFancier models have obstacle recognition, and some even use AI-powered cameras to tell popcorn from poop and avoid the latter. If you want one of those, check out my best robot vacuum buying guide. But if you think you can manage the task of picking up after yourself (and your puppy), a budget bot will save you a lot of money and still do a good job cleaning your floor. \nFeatured in this article\n\n\n\n\nHow I test robot vacuums\nTo judge its vacuuming power, I run every robot vacuum through a series of tests on hardwood and carpet, including flour, kitty litter, oatmeal, and pet and human hair. I test obstacle avoidance using cables, shoes, socks, and bed skirts. I test mopping effectiveness on hardwood and tile floors using dried and moist messes. \nIf the robot has an auto-empty dock, I test to see how well it empties the onboard bin as well as any other features of the dock. I run the robot vacs around three different levels in my home to see how they handle different surfaces, room transitions, and edge sensing. I evaluate how long they run before needing to recharge and test each app, focusing on its mapping functions to see how simple they are to use and how reliable they are. \nI also examine each robot’s build quality and parts availability, and I totally judge them based on how much my cat Boone likes to play with them.\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nYes, there are sub-$200 robots out there. No, I do not recommend you buy them. With so many new models coming out almost daily, it’s better to look for a sale on an older model from a well-known company than buy a no-name budget bot. \nYou can pick up a brand new, two-year-old Roomba or Roborock with mapping and advanced navigation for half its original price. These gadgets should last for years, so it’s not like buying last season’s Prada slip-ons.\nThat said, sales are hard to keep track of, so some of the prices listed here may seem high for a budget bot. If you see one that fits your needs, keep an eye on The Verge’s deals page for when they go on an even better sale. \n\n\n\n\n\nCleaning prowess\nThe cheaper the bot, the more important suction power is, as they tend to have fewer features that improve cleaning. Higher-end robots have things like better brushes, carpet boost mode, and dirt detection. \nAt a minimum, look for 2,500Pa (if the manufacturer lists suction power; some don’t). I also much prefer rubber roller brushes or a rubber/bristle hybrid over just bristle brushes. Rubber rollers get up more dirt and get tangled less than bristles.\n\n\n\n\n\nA mop (or not)\nBear in mind that most budget mopping bots don’t really mop — it’s more just using a damp cloth to pick up the fine dust the robot’s vacuum left behind, which is useful but not essential. Mop attachments with water reservoirs also take up space on a robot and mean a smaller bin.\n\n\n\n\n\nA big bin\nA big bin means you don’t need to empty it as often. Eight hundred milliliters is the largest I’ve seen, but anything over 450 ml is decent on a budget bot. With many bots now pulling double duty as mopping robots and the prevalence of auto-empty docks, it’s hard to find robots with big bins. But if you’re on a budget and don’t want to spend extra for the dock, a big bin will mean less hands-on time with your vacuum.\n\n\n\n\n\nOr an auto-empty option\nIf you can swing it, I strongly recommend an auto-empty dock, and there are finally some cheaper versions out there. While it’s a nice-to-have rather than a must-have, delegating the chore of emptying the bin to the robot does mean your floors will be cleaner since a vacuum with a full bin won’t suck up dirt. Many standalone robots now have an auto-empty dock option you can add later if you want to wait and see, but buying them together is generally cheaper.\n\n\n\n\n\nNavigation / mapping\nWe are starting to see true budget bots use the vSLAM (visual simultaneous localization and mapping) or lidar-powered navigation or mapping found on higher-end robots, albeit lower-level versions. Some, use the bump and roll technique, with more now adding a gyroscope function that at least makes them go in a straight line.\nChoosing an older version of a high-end robot will get you the better navigation, but I’ve also included a few bump-and-roll bots with basic mapping capability, which makes the experience better all around. Non-mapping bots may miss entire sections of your home and, when they start again after charging, may go over the area they last cleaned. However, mapping is less important if you want a bot for a single room or small apartment.\n\n\n\n\n\nGood battery life / long runtime\nWhile most bots can recharge and resume (go back to their charging base and refuel before going back out again), a bot that can go for at least two hours on one charge will get the job done more quickly and be less annoying. I look for at least 120 minutes of runtime (180 is the best).\n\n\n\n\n\nA decent app\nA lot of budget bots have barely usable apps; this is another reason why buying a lower-cost option from a company with higher-end models gets you a better experience, as the app is usually more polished.\nA good basic app, though, should have the ability to set multiple schedules to send the robot out, an option for a do-not-disturb period (so it doesn’t start up again at 2AM because it finally recharged), and a way to link to voice assistants and smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple’s Siri.\n\n\n\n\n\nRepairability\nEven at the budget end, you’ll be spending $200 to $300 on a robot vacuum, so repairability and the availability of replacement parts are a big bonus.\n\n\n\n\nBest budget robot vacuum \nSuction power: 5,300Pa / Dustbin capacity: 300ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Mopping option: Yes / Mapping: Yes, lidar / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Runtime: 100 mins, 2,600mAh battery/ Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nFor around $300, the Tapo RV30 Max Plus is a very capable robot vacuum and mop with some key features usually only found on vacuums that are more than twice its price. These include room-specific cleaning, multiple suction and water levels, smart lidar-based navigation, and an auto-empty dock. With brands like Roomba and Roborock, you’re often paying double for the privilege of not having to empty the bot’s bin.\nThanks to lidar navigation, the RV30 did an excellent job of navigating my house, cleaning the perimeters of the rooms, and then using a mesh grid to clean inside the rooms. I did have to tidy up before it ran, though, as there’s no camera on board or AI-powered obstacle detection — so cables and socks will trip it up. \nIts 5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price, and ably sucked up Cheerios and dry oatmeal on hard flooring. It left some of the finer dust and debris, as its single bristle / rubber brush isn’t super effective. It fared less well on carpet. However, in the app, I could set it to clean a room three times for each job, after which it generally picked up all visible debris.\nMopping was better than average for a mop with no pressure or oscillation. It has a wide mop pad, and the bot has a big 300ml tank (which also incorporates a 300ml dustbin), so it applies enough water for a good surface clean.\nAnother unique feature for a budget robot is the ability to set customized cleaning for each room, choosing from five suction levels and three water levels as well as three rotations.\n\n5,200Pa suction power is impressive on a bot at this price\n\n\nThe Tapo app is very simple to use, with an easy-to-edit map that lets you add virtual walls and no-go zones, add furniture, and designate carpet areas. There’s no carpet sensing, so you need to tell it where carpets are if you don’t want it to mop them. You can also set the cleaning direction and build up to four maps — again, features usually only found on higher-end robots.\nIt’s also easy to start a clean from the app, and I really like that you can tap on the map to send the robot to that spot.\nThe biggest downside of the Tapo is its tiny battery, which is just 2,600mAh. That is half the size of most vacs, and it couldn’t clean my entire 800-square-foot downstairs without needing to go back and recharge. It also takes a while to charge and occasionally has trouble repositioning itself on its dock.\nYou can get the RV30 without the auto-empty dock for around $80 less if you prefer an even simpler robot vacuum setup. This way, it will fit under a couch or bed, but you’ll have to manually empty its bin.\nBest budget robot vacuum and mop\nSuction power: 6,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 400ml / Runtime: 180 mins, 5,200mAh battery / Brush style: dual rubber / Auto-empty dock option: yes / Mapping: yes, lidar navigation / Keep-out zones: yes, virtual / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roborock S8 is a great vacuum that mops well and has AI-powered obstacle detection—a rarity at this price point. Its dual rubber roller brushes and 6,000Pa of suction do an excellent job on hard floors and carpets, and its flat mop that vibrates is effective at scrubbing your floors. \nThere’s the option of pairing the S8 with a fairly sleek auto-empty dock, but unlike Roborock’s QRevo line (which starts at around $600), the dock won’t automatically fill the water tank or wash the mop; you’ll have to do that work manually.\nFormerly a flagship robot vacuum for Roborock, this once $750 bot can now be found for well under $500, even with its auto-empty dock. Its flat mop pad vibrates 3,000 times a second to simulate some good old-fashioned scrubbing, and the bot comes with an extra-large on-board water tank, which means it actually gets wet enough to be effective.\nThe S8 can be set to mop only — something few budget bots offer, and its mop-only mode does an excellent job, moving in a tighter “Z” pattern and going over the floors twice. It also has a slow option for a more thorough cleaning. I liked to send it out to vacuum everywhere first, then recharge and go out again to mop, which resulted in sparklingly clean floors. It does take a long time, though.\nAnother great feature at this price is that the S8 has carpet sensing and can raise its mops a few millimeters to avoid dampening your carpets. Most other budget mopping bots require you to remove the mop pads when vacuuming carpet or set keep-out zones around your rugs. This bot can also raise its wheels when it cleans messes like ketchup to prevent its brushes from getting sticky.\nHowever, the mop-raising feature can only clear low-pile rugs, so I had to set no-mopping zones around my plush floor coverings. The S8 requires a fair amount of hands-on time since you have to refill its reservoir manually and wash the mopping pads (you can throw them in the washing machine). If you want to avoid those chores, you’ll need to bump up to about $600 and get whichever Roborock QRevo vac and mop is on sale. This adds spinning mopping pads and an auto wash/dry/refill dock.\nBest budget robot vacuum for pet hair\nSuction Power: 5,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 770ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Mopping option: Yes / Mapping: Yes, lidar / Suction power: 5,500Pa / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Runtime: 240 mins, 5,200mAh battery / Brush style: dual, rubber / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nMy recommendation for families with pets who don’t want to spend a small fortune on an auto-empty robot vacuum is to buy a good bot with a big bin. These are getting harder to find now that every bot wants to be a multitasker and also mop (the water reservoir takes up valuable dustbin room). So, I’m very pleased with Roborock’s Q5 Pro with its 770ml dustbin. \nThis huge bin pairs with dual rubber roller brushes that are better at getting pet hair out of rugs than single brushes. The rubber is also less prone than bristles to getting tangled with hair, and combined with 5,500Pa suction power, this vacuum does a good job on very dirty floors. It does have a removable mopping pad with a small water tank built into it, too, which is useful for cleaning up the fine dust left behind by the vacuum, but it isn’t going to scrub your floors. It will, however, keep the pet hair at bay.\nDon’t confuse this with the cheaper Roborock Q5, however. That bot has a smaller bin, lower suction, shorter runtime, and only one roller brush. It’s worth spending the extra for the Pro.\nThe Q5 Pro Plus pairs the bot with the redesigned Roborock auto-empty dock if you really don’t like emptying the robot’s onboard bin, normally a hefty price bump, it’s on sale for $360 at Amazon. The dock is relatively compact and lightweight compared to previous versions. However, considering the size of the Q5 Pro’s bin, you’d only have to empty it three times before the dock’s 2.5-liter bag is also full.\nThe Q5 Pro doesn’t have AI-powered obstacle avoidance, although it will dodge shoes and larger objects. It does have a huge 5,200mAh battery that will run for about four hours. It uses the excellent Roborock app and has all the same software features of the higher-end Roborock’s family, including lidar mapping and navigation, digital keep-out zones, room-specific cleaning, zone cleaning, and voice control.\nBest basic bump-and-roll bot\nSuction power: unknown / Dustbin capacity: 425ml /  Runtime: 120 mins / Brush style: single bristle / rubber hybrid / Auto-empty dock option: no / Mapping: no / Keep-out zones: no / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe Shark Ion’s big bin, simple app experience, decent battery life, repairability, and bullish nature make this an excellent bump-and-roll bot. It doesn’t map or have any special navigation features other than colliding with things and changing direction. It’s not fancy, but it gets the job done.\nIt’s a good one to stick under a bed or desk and set to run when you’re not home, as it’s loud and rattly and will bang into everything in its path. But its big wheels and 120-minute runtime mean it’s less prone to getting stuck or running out of juice than simpler $200 bots. \nUnlike many budget bots, it uses a hybrid roller brush that’s both bristle and plastic and doesn’t get as tangled as standard bristle brushes. Its short, squat side brushes are surprisingly effective at getting debris into the robot’s path, and because they’re short, they’re less prone to getting tangled in stray cords.\nBut the best thing ‘bout this bot is its tank-like wheels that will roll right over anything in its path, including high transitions between rooms, obstacles like lounger chair legs, and other furniture traps that regularly stump other bots. That’s a good thing, as there’s no mapping, obstacle detection, or any way to set keep-out zones here. This bot just goes. \nAnother bonus: replacement parts are easily available, making it simple to repair and just keep going.\nShark doesn’t share suction power specs, but it ably handled all my tests, including the toughest: raw oatmeal. Those little flakes are hard to pick up; side brushes will spin them all over the floor. It did a good job on pet hair, too, although, like most robots I tested, it required at least two runs to get everything up effectively.\nThe app is super basic: just on / off, scheduling, and a choice of three power levels (all loud). Disappointingly, you can only schedule it once a day. Most robots can be programmed to do two to three passes, but in place of that, I like the option to schedule it to go out twice to make sure it gets the job done. I couldn’t do that with the Shark. Still, you can press its button or use the app to send it out again if needed.\nBest budget Roomba robot vacuum\nSuction power: unknown / Dustbin capacity: 419ml / Runtime: 90 minutes / Brush style: dual rubber / Auto-empty dock option: yes / Mopping option: yes / Mapping: yes / Keep-out zones: physical only / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Siri Shortcuts\nThe Roomba i5 is the follow-up to my previous top pick for a budget robot, the Roomba i3. It’s not the cheapest bot on the block, but its cleaning chops, attractive design, good software, and robust, easily-repairable hardware make it a good choice for spending a smaller budget. \nThe i5 brings mopping capability to the lower end of iRobot’s line via a swappable mopping bin that adds a flat mopping pad and a sizable 210ml reservoir. There’s no carpet avoidance, though, so I had to roll up the ends of my carpets to block it from going on them. \nBut this bot is best as a vacuum, and it cleans almost as well as iRobot’s higher-end j7 but for a lot less money. It has slightly lower suction power, but it boasts Roomba’s signature dual roller rubber brushes, which do an excellent job of removing pet hair from hardwood floors and sucking up oatmeal from plush carpets. These are slightly different from the Roborock dual brushes, and I find the nubs make them more effective at digging out the dirt, especially from carpet. \nThe i5 has mapping and room-specific cleaning, so you can send it to clean the kitchen if you want. However, unlike my top pick, the Tapo RV30, there’s no option to set virtual keep-out zones. If you have somewhere you don’t want the bot to roam, you’ll need to buy iRobot’s virtual wall towers. It also has a relatively small bin, but you can pair it with an auto-empty base (although that doubles the cost).  \nThe i5 is a solid vacuum with big wheels and a big bumper that can easily tackle any floor surface you throw at it. It can manage most transitions and is one of the only vacs I’ve tested that doesn’t get stuck on the uneven wooden floors in my screened-in porch. It does tend to bump into things, but it gets almost everywhere you want it to and won’t be put off by a bed skirt. But if you have delicate items on rickety tables, watch out.\nAs with all Roombas, the i5 is easy to self-repair, and you can buy (not inexpensive) replacements for all its parts. I’ve actually rebuilt an i3 (the previous model) after it rolled over some dog poop. There’s no obstacle avoidance here; you have to bump up to the Roomba j7 for that (which, if you can get it on sale anywhere, is a great robot vacuum.)  \niRobot also offers the Combo j5 for $529.99 (currently on sale for $249.99 at Amazon), adding more advanced mapping, including virtual keep-out zones and better obstacle and carpet detection. It also has a shinier finish, whereas the i5 retains the fabric-covered body of the i3. If you can find the j5 on sale for close to or less than the i3 (it’s $379 with the auto-empty dock on Amazon at the time of writing), go for it. Otherwise, the i3 is your best bet for a budget Roomba. \nBest budget robot vacuum without Wi-Fi\nSuction power: 2,000Pa / Dustbin capacity: 600ml / Runtime: 100 mins / Brush style: single bristle / rubber hybrid / Auto-empty dock option: no / Mapping: no / Keep-out zones: no / Works with: n/a\nThe Eufy 11S Max is a rarity — a robot vacuum that doesn’t use Wi-Fi at all. There’s not even an app. Instead, you just press the button, and off it trundles. It also comes with a remote if you’d rather not get up off the couch, and you can use that to program it to clean at a specific time. \nThe 11S is super slim, 72.5 mm high, with no lidar tower, so it will get under most couches and very quiet. It has a big 600ml bin, and I was very impressed with how much it got up off my hardwood floors, even with its relatively small 2,000Pa of suction. There are three cleaning levels, and at the lowest, it registers around 55db, quiet enough to run in a home office.\nIt does have a smallish battery — only 100 minutes of runtime — but it will go back and recharge. For $200, this is the perfect budget bot for those wary of or who don’t want to deal with an app and Wi-Fi. It’s a bump-and-roll bot, meaning there are no real navigation skills. But it has plenty of replaceable parts, including the battery and wheels, so you can keep it going for a long time.\nBest self-cleaning, self-emptying robot vacuum / mop under $500\nSuction Power: 5,100Pa / Dustbin capacity: 360ml / Self-empty dock option: Yes / Mopping option: Yes / Mapping: Yes, lidar / Suction power: 5,100Pa / Keep-out zones: Yes, virtual / Runtime/Battery: 180 mins, 5,400mAh / Brush style: Single rubber bristle hybrid / Works with: Amazon Alexa, Google Home\nThe Yeedi Cube is the least expensive robot vacuum with the same kind of multifunction dock and high-end features as robots over $1,000. This means it can automatically fill its onboard water tank, clean and dry its mop, and empty the bin. It also has more advanced obstacle avoidance tech than most budget bots, although, unlike the pricier bots, it uses lasers to see objects, not an AI-powered camera, which is less effective. While it originally retailed for $699.99, it’s now an older model and is regularly on sale for less than $500.\nThe Yeedi resembles the Shark and Roomba in its full-speed-ahead nature. It will just run into things, and if it can clean them, great! It also only goes around larger objects. So, while it ably sucked up Cheerios and picked up all the oatmeal flakes, it got stuck on cords and socks. Definitely keep it away from pet waste.\nThe Yeedi’s mopping prowess is impressive. It scrubs the floor using a thin microfiber cloth that vibrates 2,500 times a minute to get up grime. The dock cleans the mopping pad, drains the dirty water, and auto empties the bin, but the robot carries its one-liter water tank around on its back, so it doesn’t need to go back and refill during a run.\nOne downside is that it uses a single hybrid rubber / bristle brush, which gets tangled with hair. However, combined with 5,100Pa of suction power, it did a good job of picking up dirt from the floors.\nI really liked the handle; it makes it easy to pick up the vacuum and put it where you want to clean. An onboard spot clean button means you don’t need to fuss with the app to get it to clean up a dedicated area. The map offers room-specific cleaning and keep-out zones for vacuuming and mopping but can be a bit fiddly to use.\nWhat’s coming next\niRobot’s new Roomba lineup includes several budget-friendly options — including the $319.99 Roomba 105 Combo and the $469.99 Roomba 205 DustCompactor Combo, neither of which we’ve tested. Both entry-level models can vacuum and mop, offer lidar navigation and mapping, and tout 7,000Pa of suction power. They also both offer virtual keep-out zones and automatic carpet detection and avoidance; however, the 205 features a new onboard debris and dust compactor, which iRobot says allows you to go eight weeks without emptying the vacuum.\nUpdate, April 7th: Adjusted pricing / availability and added a mention of iRobot’s latest Roomba models.","summary":"Today’s robot vacuums are becoming a bit like cars: with all the features, upgrades, and fancy trimmings available these days, it’s easy to forget that they can just be simple machines that get us from point A to point B.

And you’ve got a slew of great options to pick from; it’s hard to make a bad choice.</p>\n\n<p>There are longtime heavyweights like Bose and Sony to pick from. Apple has quickly carved into the market with the luxurious AirPods Max. And if you’ve got an ear that demands the best audio quality, headphones from Bowers &amp; Wilkins and Sennheiser might appeal to you more than the mainstream contenders.</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone loves the feel of earbuds, and there are scenarios where over-ear and on-ear headphones are just simpler or make more sense than wireless buds — particularly if lengthy battery life matters to you.</p>\n\n<p>No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">How we test noise-canceling headphones</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">We put our top picks for noise-canceling headphones through many hours of testing. Since their ability to tamp down the loudness of your surroundings is critical, we use them in a variety of environments — including busy city streets, the office, coffee shops, and public transit — and for more quiet, focused listening at home.<br><br>We sample their transparency mode to see how clearly the outside world comes through and if it’s easy to carry on conversations while wearing the headphones. We have friends and family try them on and provide feedback on the fit and comfort. And, of course, we have our favorite albums and playlists on repeat to assess how each pair sounds and how much listening time you can expect from a single charge.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Comfort</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">If headphones are causing a sore spot at the top of your noggin, what good are they no matter how good they sound or cancel noise? Traditionally the lighter they are, the more comfortable headphones will prove over extended listening sessions. But manufacturers can also help improve comfort by being thoughtful in the materials they choose for ear cups and the headband that wraps over your cranium. Clamping force is another important factor; some headphones will squeeze against your head firmer than others; this can be great if you want a pair to stay put for exercise, but not ideal if you’re just trying to relax and tune out the world.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Noise cancellation</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Practically any of our picks will do an excellent job at providing distraction-free listening when on a flight, at the office, or if you’re traversing city streets. Noise-canceling headphones work by using built-in microphones to listen to the sounds in your environment, and they invert those soundwaves to eliminate the cacophony of everyday life.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Sound quality</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Having powerful noise-canceling used to mean compromising on sound quality, but that’s simply not the case anymore. Most of today’s flagship ANC headphones provide dynamic, rich, and immersive sound. They support a variety of Bluetooth audio codecs, and some (like Sony’s LDAC and aptX HD) can deliver higher bitrates than the status quo AAC and SBC codecs. But don’t get bogged down in those details; headphones that are tuned well with the right components can make your music sound fantastic regardless of codecs.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Battery life</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">One benefit of buying headphones instead of earbuds is that they can last much longer on a single charge. Whereas you’ll need to plop most earbuds back into their case after five hours or so, wireless headphones can keep the music going for around 20 hours. And some recent models can even exceed that and hit 40 hours.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Multipoint pairing</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">We all try to do our best at multitasking, and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity is essential for headphones to meet the same challenge. Multipoint allows your noise-canceling headphones to pair with two devices at the same time. This makes it easy to take a call on your phone and get right back to the music you were playing on your laptop without fussing with Bluetooth settings menus.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Bonus features</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Headphones are increasingly gaining features that are exclusive to individual manufacturer ecosystems. For example, the AirPods Max are capable of head-tracking spatial audio and other tricks like audio sharing — but only if you’re listening to them with one of the company’s other products, like an iPhone, Mac, or iPad.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>The “best” headphones for you will differ based on which of those factors you prioritize and care about most, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones remains<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23067645/sony-wh-1000xm5-noise-canceling-headphones-review\">Sony’s WH-1000XM5</a>.

The changes result in greater comfort when you’re wearing them on your head for extended periods of time — like on a flight or if you’re at the office.</p>\n\n<p>Noise cancellation has been further improved from the already-stellar performance of the M4, putting Sony at the front of the pack compared to all major competitors. Sound quality is more detailed and balanced than the older 1000XM4; the low end is still punchy but tighter and less boomy than before.

And like other high-end headphones, the 1000XM5 can detect when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause.</p>\n\n<p>The main downside of the WH-1000XM5 is that, at $399.99, they’re more expensive than prior models.

The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations.

And you’ve got a slew of great options to pick from; it’s hard to make a bad choice.\nThere are longtime heavyweights like Bose and Sony to pick from. Apple has quickly carved into the market with the luxurious AirPods Max. And if you’ve got an ear that demands the best audio quality, headphones from Bowers & Wilkins and Sennheiser might appeal to you more than the mainstream contenders.\nNot everyone loves the feel of earbuds, and there are scenarios where over-ear and on-ear headphones are just simpler or make more sense than wireless buds — particularly if lengthy battery life matters to you.\nNo matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed.\n\n\nHow we test noise-canceling headphones\nWe put our top picks for noise-canceling headphones through many hours of testing. Since their ability to tamp down the loudness of your surroundings is critical, we use them in a variety of environments — including busy city streets, the office, coffee shops, and public transit — and for more quiet, focused listening at home.\nWe sample their transparency mode to see how clearly the outside world comes through and if it’s easy to carry on conversations while wearing the headphones. We have friends and family try them on and provide feedback on the fit and comfort. And, of course, we have our favorite albums and playlists on repeat to assess how each pair sounds and how much listening time you can expect from a single charge.\n\n\n\n\n\nComfort\nIf headphones are causing a sore spot at the top of your noggin, what good are they no matter how good they sound or cancel noise? Traditionally the lighter they are, the more comfortable headphones will prove over extended listening sessions. But manufacturers can also help improve comfort by being thoughtful in the materials they choose for ear cups and the headband that wraps over your cranium. Clamping force is another important factor; some headphones will squeeze against your head firmer than others; this can be great if you want a pair to stay put for exercise, but not ideal if you’re just trying to relax and tune out the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nNoise cancellation\nPractically any of our picks will do an excellent job at providing distraction-free listening when on a flight, at the office, or if you’re traversing city streets. Noise-canceling headphones work by using built-in microphones to listen to the sounds in your environment, and they invert those soundwaves to eliminate the cacophony of everyday life.\n\n\n\n\n\nSound quality\nHaving powerful noise-canceling used to mean compromising on sound quality, but that’s simply not the case anymore. Most of today’s flagship ANC headphones provide dynamic, rich, and immersive sound. They support a variety of Bluetooth audio codecs, and some (like Sony’s LDAC and aptX HD) can deliver higher bitrates than the status quo AAC and SBC codecs. But don’t get bogged down in those details; headphones that are tuned well with the right components can make your music sound fantastic regardless of codecs.\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery life\nOne benefit of buying headphones instead of earbuds is that they can last much longer on a single charge. Whereas you’ll need to plop most earbuds back into their case after five hours or so, wireless headphones can keep the music going for around 20 hours. And some recent models can even exceed that and hit 40 hours.\n\n\n\n\n\nMultipoint pairing\nWe all try to do our best at multitasking, and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity is essential for headphones to meet the same challenge. Multipoint allows your noise-canceling headphones to pair with two devices at the same time. This makes it easy to take a call on your phone and get right back to the music you were playing on your laptop without fussing with Bluetooth settings menus.\n\n\n\n\n\nBonus features\nHeadphones are increasingly gaining features that are exclusive to individual manufacturer ecosystems. For example, the AirPods Max are capable of head-tracking spatial audio and other tricks like audio sharing — but only if you’re listening to them with one of the company’s other products, like an iPhone, Mac, or iPad.\n\n\nThe “best” headphones for you will differ based on which of those factors you prioritize and care about most, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones remains Sony’s WH-1000XM5. They offer a combination of sound quality, comfort, and great noise cancellation that’s hard to beat.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best wireless headphones for most people\nThe best noise-canceling headphones for travel\nThe best wireless headphones for iPhone owners\nThe best-sounding wireless headphones\nThe noise-canceling headphones with the best battery life\n\nThe best wireless headphones for most people\nBattery life: 30 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: LDAC, AAC, SBC Connectors: USB-C (charging), 3.5mm headphone jack (audio)\nSony’s WH-1000XM5 have a completely different design from their predecessors. The changes result in greater comfort when you’re wearing them on your head for extended periods of time — like on a flight or if you’re at the office.\nNoise cancellation has been further improved from the already-stellar performance of the M4, putting Sony at the front of the pack compared to all major competitors. Sound quality is more detailed and balanced than the older 1000XM4; the low end is still punchy but tighter and less boomy than before. The M5 offer the best voice call performance in the 1000X series to date, and they can connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued in on what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet. \nSony’s headphones also include unique features like “speak to chat,” which automatically pauses your music and pipes in ambient audio whenever you start talking. Or you can hold one hand over the right ear cup to activate quick attention mode, which is convenient when grabbing a coffee or listening to airport announcements. And like other high-end headphones, the 1000XM5 can detect when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause.\nThe main downside of the WH-1000XM5 is that, at $399.99, they’re more expensive than prior models. That’s a big reason to consider the 1000XM4, which were our previous pick for the best noise-canceling headphones. They remain part of Sony’s lineup and can often be found on sale.\nRead my full Sony WH-1000XM5 review.\nThe best noise-canceling headphones for travel\nBattery life: 24 hours / Multipoint: Yes / Audio codecs: aptX Adaptive, AAC, SBC Connectors: USB-C (charging), 2.5mm headphone jack (audio)\nBose’s QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are basically a blend of the company’s prior Noise Canceling Headphones 700 and QuietComfort 45 that borrow the best traits from both — while throwing in a new “immersive audio” listening mode. Like past Bose cans, they’re very light and comfortable on your head, even when worn for long stretches of time. Best of all, unlike the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, these can be folded to make them easier to travel with.\nTheir 24-hour battery life is more than adequate, and Bose has added support for the aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec for improved audio fidelity on Android devices.\nThe immersive audio feature works well on some songs, but less so on others. It’s worth experimenting with, but even if you leave it off entirely, you’re left with best-in-class noise cancellation, pleasing sound, and a helpful “aware” transparency mode.\nRead my full Bose QC Ultra Headphones review.\nThe best wireless headphones for iPhone owners\nBattery life: 20 hours / Multipoint: No / Audio codecs: AAC, SBC Connectors: Lightning (audio and charging)\nThere was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones in 2020. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls instead of relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes. \nThe most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver audio quality that’s up there with the best high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage and fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs.\nApple’s noise cancellation is on par with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow their daunting price.  \nBut the AirPods Max do have faults.
