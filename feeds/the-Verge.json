The original Surface tablet started off life in Groene’s sketchbook, with a set of doodles about kickstands that formed the basis of months of 3D-printed prototypes that were held together with string. Microsoft went on to launch the Surface RT tablet in 2012, and the Surface Pro has had a lasting effect on hybrid laptop designs over the past 10 years.\nAmazon’s hiring of Groene comes just months after Xbox cofounder J Allard joined Panay’s devices and services team to work on “new ideas.” Allard departed Microsoft in 2010, following his work on the company’s canceled Courier tablet.\nGroene and Allard aren’t the only notable recent former Microsoft hires for Amazon, though. Former Windows Cloud executive Aidan Marcuss also joined Amazon this week, leading the Fire TV, ads, and AppStore teams.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344205/microsoft-ralf-groene-amazon-devices-services-design-chief","isoDate":"2025-01-15T10:02:20.000Z"},{"title":"Elon Musk is being sued by the feds over the way he bought Twitter","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/14/24343978/elon-musk-sued-sec-twitter-acquisition","pubDate":"2025-01-15T00:21:01.000Z","author":"Richard Lawler","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Elon Musk in front of the Twitter logo.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qtDJ5Dq4RdEuYg4bvuYTbZrp9w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73847400/VRG_Illo_STK022_K_Radtke_Musk_Twitter_Upside_Down.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Illustration by Kristen Radtke / The Verge; Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"lopFbA\">Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter has resulted in a federal lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/enforcement-litigation/litigation-releases/lr-26219\">by the Securities and Exchange Commission</a> alleging that he broke securities laws with a late disclosure, and saved $150 million in the process. </p>\n<p id=\"3p1UGO\">Before Musk <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/25/23028323/elon-musk-twitter-offer-buyout-hostile-takeover-ownership\">agreed</a> to buy Twitter for $44 billion, before he tried to back out of that deal, before he was forced to go through with it, and before he changed its name to X, he started by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/4/23009622/elon-musk-twitter-shares-free-speech\">acquiring a substantial stake</a> in the company but didn’t reveal that fact until weeks later.</p>\n<p id=\"jV5L2W\">The only problem, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/27/23144536/sec-elon-musk-twitter-disclosure-inquiry\">as the SEC pointed out then</a>, is that by the time he disclosed that stake, it was outside the agency’s required 10-day window.
