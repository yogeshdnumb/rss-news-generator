Signs have gone up (and back down), icons are changing, and an old plan is new.\nHow’d we get here?\nOn April 4th, 2022, we learned that Musk had purchased enough shares of Twitter to become its largest individual shareholder. Eventually, he followed up with an unsolicited offer to buy 100 percent of Twitter’s shares for $54.20 each, or about $44 billion.  Twitter accepted Musk’s offer, but then things got weird because he tried to cancel the deal.\nThere was a lot of back-and-forth about bots and text messages, but in the end, Musk settled on buying the company rather than facing a deposition or Chancery Court trial and eventually strode into Twitter HQ carrying a sink.\nSince then, there have been layoffs, more layoffs, and even more layoffs — plus drama over Substack, unpaid bills, and blue checkmarks. With ad revenue still down from previous years, Elon finally abdicated the role of CEO in May 2023, installing longtime NBCUniversal ad executive Linda Yaccarino.\nRead on for the latest updates about what’s going on inside Twitter right now.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\nTrump drops his Twitter lawsuit appeal.\n\t\t\t\nX says its payments service will finally launch this year\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk email to X staff: ‘we’re barely breaking even’\n\t\t\t\nDozens of subreddits are banning links to X\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk is being sued by the feds over the way he bought Twitter\n\t\t\t\nHow Elon Musk’s xAI is quietly taking over X\n\t\t\t\nElon Musk says X’s algorithm pushes “too much negativity.”\n\t\t\t\nX’s new ‘Aurora’ image generator is gone.\n\t\t\t\nX gives Grok a new photorealistic AI image generator\n\t\t\t\nWho actually owns your social media accounts?
