The European Commission announced today that Apple has been served a €500 million (about $570 million) penalty after ruling <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184629/apple-dma-steering-infringement-ruling\">that its App Store “anti-steering” practices</a> failed to comply with DMA antitrust rules. Meta has been fined €200 million (about $230 million) following similar charges regarding <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24189796/eu-meta-dma-violation-pay-consent-ads-model\">Facebook and Instagram’s ‘pay or consent’ ad model</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Both companies have been given 60 days to comply with the ruling, which in Apple’s case includes removing its restrictions on developers, or face the risk of periodic penalty payments. Apple has confirmed that it intends to appeal the ruling, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/23/technology/apple-meta-eu-fines-competition-law.html\"><em>The New York Times</em> reports</a> that Meta plans to do the same.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24040543/eu-dma-digital-markets-act-big-tech-antitrust\">The DMA</a> became law in May 2023, and is designed to increase competition across digital markets within the EU. Companies designated under the law as “gatekeepers” — Apple, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, ByteDance, and Microsoft — over “core platform services” they offer must comply with rules intended to reduce anticompetitive behavior. Companies can be charged up to 10 percent of their annual global revenue for DMA violations, and up to 20 percent for repeat offenses.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Enabling free business and consumer choice is at the core of the rules laid down in the Digital Markets Act.

In <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/dma/dma-ncs.pdf\">its own compliance report, Apple says</a> the compliance measures it has taken to open up its App Store place users and developers at greater risk, and that it will “continue to urge the European Commission to allow it to take other measures to protect its users.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Commission says that the size of Apple’s fine “takes into account the gravity and duration of the non-compliance.” The company has also been ordered to remove the restrictions on developers linking out to and promoting other payment services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Today’s announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free,” Apple spokesperson Emma Wilson told <em>The Verge</em>. “We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for. Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way. We will appeal and continue engaging with the Commission in service of our European customers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meta was charged for forcing Facebook and Instagram users to either pay <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955987/instagram-facebook-without-ads-eu-subscription\">a subscription fee to remove ads</a>, or consent to having their personal data used for ad-supported versions of the platforms. To address the DMA compliance violations, Meta has allowed Facebook and Instagram users within the EU who don’t pay to remove ads <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294463/meta-plans-to-walk-back-its-pay-or-consent-ad-model-in-the-eu\">to see fewer unskippable, full-screen “personalized ads.”</a> Meta said in a <a href=\"https://transparency.meta.com/reports/regulatory-transparency-reports/\">compliance report published on March 6th</a> that it has “continued to receive additional demands that go beyond what is written in the law” despite its efforts to comply with DMA requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,” says Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, in a <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/metas-statement-in-response-to-the-european-commissions-decision-on-the-digital-markets-act/\">statement</a>. “This isn’t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service.

Like Apple, Google is also being scrutinized over “anti-steering” practices in its app marketplace — meaning behavior that market-dominating platforms use to dissuade consumers from using alternative services.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The fines announced today are below the maximum penalties of around $16 billion for Meta and $39 billion for Apple based on 2024 earnings. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/2c1b6bfd-ce73-451d-8123-0df964266ae8\"><em>The Financial Times</em> reported in January</a> that the EU was planning to soften its regulatory practices around Big Tech following an increase in pressure from the US, with the new EU Commission that took office in December <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c3933e2f-787e-453b-82eb-a981ddd48a31\">reportedly being more focused on enforcing compliance</a> than issuing hefty fines. Today’s fines were expected in March, but were reportedly delayed over fears that the decisions would <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates\">escalate ongoing trade tensions</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Apple is no stranger to EU antitrust penalties, having <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24005938/european-commission-antitrust-apple-investigation-anti-steering-rules-app-developers\">previously been fined €1.84 billion (about $2 billion)</a> last year over the App Store’s anti-steering practices following an antitrust lawsuit filed by Spotify — a case that predates the DMA. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296391/meta-facebook-marketplace-840-million-eu-fine\">Meta was also fined €797.7 million</a> (about $840 million) in November last year for giving itself unfair market advantages by linking Facebook and Marketplace, and<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/22/23732461/meta-eu-privacy-fine-us-data-transfers-1-3-billion\"> €1.2 billion (about $1.3 billion) in 2023</a> for transferring the Facebook data of EU citizens to the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These fines come as tensions are rising between European policymakers and US President Donald Trump, who has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345174/tech-leaders-companies-support-donald-trump-presidency\">befriended deep-pocketed US tech CEOs</a> that have <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350353/trump-bends-to-the-tech-oligarchy\">likened EU fines placed against their companies to a form of taxation</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"Apple and Meta are the first companies to be fined for violations under the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).

To address the DMA compliance violations, Meta has allowed Facebook and Instagram users within the EU who don’t pay to remove ads to see fewer unskippable, full-screen “personalized ads.” Meta said in a compliance report published on March 6th that it has “continued to receive additional demands that go beyond what is written in the law” despite its efforts to comply with DMA requirements. \n“The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,” says Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, in a statement. “This isn’t just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.”\nThe initial compliance investigations into Apple and Meta were announced in March 2024, alongside plans to investigate Google’s parent company Alphabet over concerns regarding treating its own services more favorably in Search rankings compared to services provided by third-party rivals. Like Apple, Google is also being scrutinized over “anti-steering” practices in its app marketplace — meaning behavior that market-dominating platforms use to dissuade consumers from using alternative services.\nThe fines announced today are below the maximum penalties of around $16 billion for Meta and $39 billion for Apple based on 2024 earnings. The Financial Times reported in January that the EU was planning to soften its regulatory practices around Big Tech following an increase in pressure from the US, with the new EU Commission that took office in December reportedly being more focused on enforcing compliance than issuing hefty fines. Today’s fines were expected in March, but were reportedly delayed over fears that the decisions would escalate ongoing trade tensions. \nApple is no stranger to EU antitrust penalties, having previously been fined €1.84 billion (about $2 billion) last year over the App Store’s anti-steering practices following an antitrust lawsuit filed by Spotify — a case that predates the DMA. Meta was also fined €797.7 million (about $840 million) in November last year for giving itself unfair market advantages by linking Facebook and Marketplace, and €1.2 billion (about $1.3 billion) in 2023 for transferring the Facebook data of EU citizens to the US.\nThese fines come as tensions are rising between European policymakers and US President Donald Trump, who has befriended deep-pocketed US tech CEOs that have likened EU fines placed against their companies to a form of taxation.","summary":"Apple and Meta are the first companies to be fined for violations under the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA).

It has made several changes to the initiative over the years, such as proposals like its Topics API to assign interests to users based on their web activity and other tools it said could target ads while still offering some privacy. But following years of delays and scrutiny, Google said last year that it would let users choose whether to opt into a cookie-less Chrome. Now, it appears the initiative has come almost completely to an end.\n“As we’ve engaged with the ecosystem, including publishers, developers, regulators, and the ads industry, it remains clear that there are divergent perspectives on making changes that could impact the availability of third-party cookies,” Chavez writes, adding that Google “will not be rolling out a new standalone prompt for third-party cookies.”\nThe Movement for an Open Web (MOW), which filed a complaint with the CMA about the initiative in 2020, said Google’s latest update is an “admission” that the Privacy Sandbox is over.\n“Google’s intention was to remove open and interoperable communications standards to bring digital advertising traffic under their sole control and, with this announcement, that aim is now over,” MOW co-founder James Rosewell said in an emailed statement to The Verge. “They’ve recognised that the regulatory obstacles to their monopolistic project are insurmountable and have given up.”","summary":"Google’s plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome is officially over.
