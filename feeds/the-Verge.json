I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23775534/switch-phones-ios-android-iphone-google-pixel-samsung-esim\">so routine that it’s mostly painless</a>.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Strong software support</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">At least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">A good screen</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Since you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens, but for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">Serviceable storage space</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">If you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you’ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you’ll accumulate over the years. Ideally you’ll get at least 128GB built in, but at a minimum I look for 64GB with the option to expand space via a MicroSD card.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\">One good rear camera, not four mediocre ones</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Upgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array — those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless.&nbsp;</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>Many of our picks run about $400 or $500, but there are great options for $300 and under, too. You can find a bright, high-definition OLED screen or a battery that lasts for days. If you can hone in on the one or two features that are most important to you and you’re willing to compromise elsewhere, you can get a phone that suits your needs for half the price of a flagship.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"in-this-article\"><strong>In this article</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"#YvXuY9\">The best iPhone under $500</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"#GfPhzN\">The best Android phone under $500</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"#iM0ov7\">The best budget phone that performs like a flagship</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"#u387Gc\">The phone under $400</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"#QXADdb\">Other budget phones we tested</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p>What compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and most lack official water-resistance ratings, wireless charging, and NFC chips for contactless payment.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"YvXuY9\">The best cheap iPhone</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.1-inch, 1170p OLED/ <strong>Processor:</strong> A18 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / <strong>Charging:</strong> 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP6</em></em>8</p>\n\n<p>If I was making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly <em>cheap.</em> If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.</p>\n\n<p>There’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Another heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/28/24279804/apple-intelligence-ios-18-1-siri-ai\">is underwhelming</a> and the most interesting bits <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/626035/apple-delays-upgraded-siri-intelligence-longer-than-we-thought\">won’t arrive anytime soon</a>. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"YIwYGs\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/620155/iphone-16e-review-c1-modem-battery-camera\">Read my full iPhone 16E review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"GfPhzN\">The best Android phone under $500</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.1-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / <strong>Processor:</strong> Tensor G3 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 64-megapixel f/1.89 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>4,492mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 18W wired, 7.5W wireless / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP67</em></em></p>\n\n<p>Google offers some very good high-end phones in the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24232480/google-pixel-9-review-screen-camera-battery\">Pixel 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24225221/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-review-ai-gemini-screen-battery-camera\">9 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24225221/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-review-ai-gemini-screen-battery-camera\">9 Pro XL</a>, but it’s the company’s budget phone that makes the most sense. For $500, the Pixel 8A offers a whole lot of what makes its pricier siblings good, but at roughly half the cost.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a modest update over the Pixel 7A, which you can still buy, but the 8A comes with one big upgrade over the previous generation: seven years of OS and security updates. If you’re the kind of person who likes to hang onto their device for a long time, that’s huge — especially in the budget category where other phones might only come with one or two platform upgrades.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25451801/DSC07458_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Google Pixel 8A showing homescreen.\" title=\"Google Pixel 8A showing homescreen.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"The Pixel 8A’s screen has bezels for days but a fast 120Hz top refresh rate. | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>The 8A is also Google’s first budget phone to come with a 120Hz display, so scrolling and animations look super smooth. You also get wireless charging and an IP67 rating for protection against water immersion. The camera system is reliable, but it’s the most obvious place where Google had to make some compromises to keep the price low. It’s a fine all-around camera, but stepping up to one of the latest Pixel models gets you improved low light performance, an updated ultrawide camera, and a whole lot of AI-powered features.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you can hold out for a bit, it’s also worth flagging the heavily rumored Google Pixel 9A, which will <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/610158/google-pixel-9a-leak-renders-camera-bump\">reportedly arrive on March 26th</a>. <em>Android Headlines</em>&nbsp;says the phone will start at $499 with 128GB of storage and ditch the camera bar entirely, allowing it to lie flat on a table. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283754/google-pixel-9a-bigger-display-price-rumors-leak\">Previous rumors</a> also point toward a 5,100mAh battery, a&nbsp;6.3-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, a Tensor G4 chip, and 8GB of RAM.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"D5luIx\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24162073/google-pixel-8a-review-specs-price-camera\">Read my full Google Pixel 8A review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"iM0ov7\">The best budget phone that performs like a flagship</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / <strong>Processor: </strong>Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</em> <em><strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, 16-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>5,500mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 80W wired / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP64</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The last-gen OnePlus 12R is $500, but it could easily trick you into thinking it costs twice as much. It comes with a very big, very nice screen, with refresh rates that go up to 120Hz and all the way down to 1Hz, making for a smooth scrolling experience when you need it and savings on battery life when you don’t. It’s a feature rarely seen on a phone under $800.</p>\n\n<p>The 12R is equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, which is a generation behind 2024’s processor du jour, the 8 Gen 3 (the latter can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-13r\">$599.99 OnePlus 13R</a>). But the 8 Gen 2 still whips — it’s hard to throw anything at this phone that it can’t handle. Less good: the 12R’s IP64 rating, which means it’s splash resistant but not fully water immersible, like the Pixel 8A.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25287583/DSC06615.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"OnePlus 12R on a green background with back panel facing up surrounded by blue translucent squares.\" title=\"OnePlus 12R on a green background with back panel facing up surrounded by blue translucent squares.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The 12R misses out on robust water resistance but delivers on performance.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>Fast charging is kind of OnePlus’ trademark, and the 12R stays true to the brand with up to 80W fast wired charging in the US (it’s up to 100W in other regions). It’s nice if you want to charge your phone on a more compressed schedule, like during your morning routine rather than at night.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I’d rather have slower wired charging if it meant I could have a feature that’s not present on the 12R: wireless charging. That is, once again, something the Pixel 8A offers. But that’s the beauty of the 12R — it knows what it is and what it isn’t. And if a low-cost phone with a big, high-quality screen and excellent performance is what you’re after, then the 12R is it.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"RfTNIu\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24072383/oneplus-12r-review-screen-camera-price\">Read my full OnePlus 12R review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"u387Gc\">The phone under $400</h2>\n\n<p><em><em><strong>Screen: </strong>6.6-inch, 1080p resolution, 120Hz OLED / <strong>Processor:</strong> Exynos 1380 <strong>Cameras:</strong> 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 13-megapixel selfie / <strong>Battery: </strong>5,000mAh / <strong>Charging:</strong> 25W wired / <strong>Weather-resistance rating:</strong> IP67</em></em></p>\n\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy A35 5G comes with surprisingly strong specs for its $399 price. They’re the kind of features you won’t really spot from the outside, but they’re important, particularly its IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Unlike virtually every other phone at this price, the A35 5G is built to withstand water immersion, so you don’t need to sweat it if your phone lands in a toilet bowl or puddle.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s another unexciting spec: four years of OS updates and five years of security updates. That’s not the very best in the budget category — the Pixel 8A takes that honor with seven years of updates — but it’s much better than the two or three years we typically see in phones well under $500.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440970/DSC07386_processed.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.723165084465,100,78.55366983107\" alt=\"Samsung A35 5G on a desk showing back panel.\" title=\"Samsung A35 5G on a desk showing back panel.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The A35 5G comes with a water-resistance rating and software support policy that are unusually strong for its class.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo: Allison Johnson / The Verge\" />\n<p>The camera is lackluster; it’s fine in bright light but struggles in dim and mixed indoor lighting. It doesn’t have the strongest processing performance you can find under $500, either, and the Samsung-made Exynos processor occasionally stutters when quickly bouncing between tasks. I was horrified — horrified! — when I accidentally texted my husband one of the automatically generated replies because it popped up at the last moment as I was trying to tap on something else. These things don’t happen when everything loads quickly.</p>\n\n<p>But overall, it’s a compelling package — especially with a big, crowd-pleasing OLED display and strong battery performance. If you’re a light user and not fussy about camera quality, the A35 5G offers some upgrades that make a real difference in the long term.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"QXADdb\">Other budget phones we tested</h2>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Unlocked-128GB-Camera-Midnight/dp/B0CT6BQV81/\">2024 Motorola Moto G Power</a> has all the makings of a good budget phone, including a lovely vegan leather exterior and wireless charging. But it’s loaded with bloatware of the worst kind, and that alone disqualifies it from our recommendations. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24105894/motorola-moto-g-power-2024-review-specs-features-apps-bloatware\">Read our impressions</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We also tested the <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/us/n300-5g\">OnePlus Nord N300</a>, which doesn’t make an appearance among our recommendations. The N300 is very affordable at $228 but cuts too many corners to include fast charging.

It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 8A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera\">new Galaxy S25</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24305866/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-review-camera-battery-screen\">Read our review</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, if you’re looking for something quite different, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23792961/nothing-phone-2-review-glyph-screen-battery-camera\">Nothing Phone 2</a> is an option with its sleek appearance and flashy interface (literally, it flashes) — just know that it’s not fully compatible with Verizon’s network.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Update, March 13th: </strong>Removed the 2022 iPhone SE and replaced it with the iPhone 16E.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"You can get a great budget device these days if you know how to pick your priorities. | Image: The Verge\n\nSome of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets.

I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless.\n\n\n\n\n\nStrong software support\nAt least a couple of years of OS upgrades and, ideally, three years of security updates. There’s no point in buying even a cheap phone if you have to replace it after just a couple of years because it stopped getting security patches.\n\n\n\n\n\nA good screen\nSince you look at it roughly two thousand times a day, your phone’s screen is one place you shouldn’t compromise. An OLED has richer contrast and color than an LCD, and the big screens on today’s phones really need at least a 1080p resolution. Faster refresh rates like 90Hz and even 120Hz are becoming more common on budget phone screens, but for my money, a smooth-scrolling LCD doesn’t look as nice as an OLED with a standard refresh rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nServiceable storage space\nIf you plan to hang onto your phone for a while, you’ll want enough storage space to accommodate all the system files, photos, and videos you’ll accumulate over the years. Ideally you’ll get at least 128GB built in, but at a minimum I look for 64GB with the option to expand space via a MicroSD card. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne good rear camera, not four mediocre ones\nUpgrades like telephoto cameras and optical image stabilization are rare in the under-$500 class, but you can still expect good, basic performance in good lighting from any modern smartphone. Low light is trickier. Phones in this class should offer a night mode to help with non-moving subjects in very dim light. And there are no bonus points awarded for adding extra macro and depth cameras to pad out the rear camera array — those 2- and 5-megapixel sensors are pretty much useless. \n\n\nMany of our picks run about $400 or $500, but there are great options for $300 and under, too. You can find a bright, high-definition OLED screen or a battery that lasts for days. If you can hone in on the one or two features that are most important to you and you’re willing to compromise elsewhere, you can get a phone that suits your needs for half the price of a flagship.\nIn this article\nThe best iPhone under $500\nThe best Android phone under $500\nThe best budget phone that performs like a flagship\nThe phone under $400\nOther budget phones we tested\nWhat compromises can you expect from a budget phone? Some combination of the following: slower processors, less storage, and worse cameras than flagship phones, almost across the board. Many have lower-resolution screens, and most lack official water-resistance ratings, wireless charging, and NFC chips for contactless payment.\nThe best cheap iPhone\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1170p OLED/ Processor: A18 Cameras: 48-megapixel f/1.6 with OIS, 12-megapixel selfie / Charging: 20W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP68\nIf I was making this recommendation to you face-to-face, you’d hear a heavy sigh. Yes, this is the cheapest new iPhone Apple makes. Yes, it comes with most of the things that make an iPhone an iPhone. But it comes with some significant tradeoffs — some of which make more sense than others — and it’s not exactly cheap. If you’re amenable to last year’s model or a refurbished iPhone 14, one of those might actually be a better option. But for an unfussy person who just wants a new iPhone for the least amount of money, the 16E will do the trick.\nThere’s a single 48-megapixel rear camera on the back, meaning there’s no ultrawide like on the regular 16. That’s an understandable tradeoff — so is the use of the older “notch” design rather than the Dynamic Island. But it’s harder to understand why Apple left out MagSafe here — that’s the ring of magnets built into the back of virtually every other iPhone since 2020. The 16E still supports wireless charging, but it can’t take advantage of the ecosystem of magnetic chargers and accessories on its own; you’ll need to add a magnetic case. This is a silly omission, and Apple should feel bad about it.\nAnother heavy sigh: the 16E supports Apple Intelligence, which you won’t get if you opt for an iPhone 15 or 14. Should you care? It’s really hard to say. What exists of Apple Intelligence so far is underwhelming and the most interesting bits won’t arrive anytime soon. If you want to future-proof your purchase as much as possible, the 16E will be ready for Apple’s AI. But don’t buy one expecting a life-changing experience now. It’s just an iPhone after all, for better and worse, and right now it’s the best price you’ll find on a brand-new one.\nRead my full iPhone 16E review.\nThe best Android phone under $500\nScreen: 6.1-inch, 1080p OLED, 120Hz / Processor: Tensor G3 Cameras: 64-megapixel f/1.89 with OIS, 13-megapixel ultrawide, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 4,492mAh / Charging: 18W wired, 7.5W wireless / Weather-resistance rating: IP67\nGoogle offers some very good high-end phones in the Pixel 9, 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL, but it’s the company’s budget phone that makes the most sense. For $500, the Pixel 8A offers a whole lot of what makes its pricier siblings good, but at roughly half the cost.\nIt’s a modest update over the Pixel 7A, which you can still buy, but the 8A comes with one big upgrade over the previous generation: seven years of OS and security updates. If you’re the kind of person who likes to hang onto their device for a long time, that’s huge — especially in the budget category where other phones might only come with one or two platform upgrades.\nThe 8A is also Google’s first budget phone to come with a 120Hz display, so scrolling and animations look super smooth. You also get wireless charging and an IP67 rating for protection against water immersion. The camera system is reliable, but it’s the most obvious place where Google had to make some compromises to keep the price low. It’s a fine all-around camera, but stepping up to one of the latest Pixel models gets you improved low light performance, an updated ultrawide camera, and a whole lot of AI-powered features.\nIf you can hold out for a bit, it’s also worth flagging the heavily rumored Google Pixel 9A, which will reportedly arrive on March 26th. Android Headlines says the phone will start at $499 with 128GB of storage and ditch the camera bar entirely, allowing it to lie flat on a table. Previous rumors also point toward a 5,100mAh battery, a 6.3-inch screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, a Tensor G4 chip, and 8GB of RAM.\nRead my full Google Pixel 8A review.\nThe best budget phone that performs like a flagship\nScreen: 6.78-inch, 1264 x 2780 120Hz OLED / Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro, 16-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,500mAh / Charging: 80W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP64\nThe last-gen OnePlus 12R is $500, but it could easily trick you into thinking it costs twice as much. It comes with a very big, very nice screen, with refresh rates that go up to 120Hz and all the way down to 1Hz, making for a smooth scrolling experience when you need it and savings on battery life when you don’t. It’s a feature rarely seen on a phone under $800.\nThe 12R is equipped with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, which is a generation behind 2024’s processor du jour, the 8 Gen 3 (the latter can be found on the $599.99 OnePlus 13R). But the 8 Gen 2 still whips — it’s hard to throw anything at this phone that it can’t handle. Less good: the 12R’s IP64 rating, which means it’s splash resistant but not fully water immersible, like the Pixel 8A.\nFast charging is kind of OnePlus’ trademark, and the 12R stays true to the brand with up to 80W fast wired charging in the US (it’s up to 100W in other regions). It’s nice if you want to charge your phone on a more compressed schedule, like during your morning routine rather than at night.\nPersonally, I’d rather have slower wired charging if it meant I could have a feature that’s not present on the 12R: wireless charging. That is, once again, something the Pixel 8A offers. But that’s the beauty of the 12R — it knows what it is and what it isn’t. And if a low-cost phone with a big, high-quality screen and excellent performance is what you’re after, then the 12R is it.\nRead my full OnePlus 12R review.\nThe phone under $400\nScreen: 6.6-inch, 1080p resolution, 120Hz OLED / Processor: Exynos 1380 Cameras: 50-megapixel f/1.8 with OIS, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 5-megapixel macro, 13-megapixel selfie / Battery: 5,000mAh / Charging: 25W wired / Weather-resistance rating: IP67\nThe Samsung Galaxy A35 5G comes with surprisingly strong specs for its $399 price. They’re the kind of features you won’t really spot from the outside, but they’re important, particularly its IP67 rating for dust and water resistance. Unlike virtually every other phone at this price, the A35 5G is built to withstand water immersion, so you don’t need to sweat it if your phone lands in a toilet bowl or puddle.\nHere’s another unexciting spec: four years of OS updates and five years of security updates. That’s not the very best in the budget category — the Pixel 8A takes that honor with seven years of updates — but it’s much better than the two or three years we typically see in phones well under $500.\nThe camera is lackluster; it’s fine in bright light but struggles in dim and mixed indoor lighting. It doesn’t have the strongest processing performance you can find under $500, either, and the Samsung-made Exynos processor occasionally stutters when quickly bouncing between tasks. I was horrified — horrified! — when I accidentally texted my husband one of the automatically generated replies because it popped up at the last moment as I was trying to tap on something else. These things don’t happen when everything loads quickly.\nBut overall, it’s a compelling package — especially with a big, crowd-pleasing OLED display and strong battery performance. If you’re a light user and not fussy about camera quality, the A35 5G offers some upgrades that make a real difference in the long term.\nOther budget phones we tested\nThe 2024 Motorola Moto G Power has all the makings of a good budget phone, including a lovely vegan leather exterior and wireless charging. But it’s loaded with bloatware of the worst kind, and that alone disqualifies it from our recommendations. Read our impressions.\nWe also tested the OnePlus Nord N300, which doesn’t make an appearance among our recommendations. The N300 is very affordable at $228 but cuts too many corners to include fast charging. The pricier 12R that snags our recommendation above offers much better overall performance. Read our review.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is another perfectly capable phone that doesn’t quite earn a recommendation here. It’s a little outside the scope of this guide at $649 anyway, but you do get a telephoto lens and a nice, big screen for that price. Still, you’re better off saving a bunch and picking up the Pixel 8A or trying to score a trade-in promo for the new Galaxy S25. Read our review.\nFinally, if you’re looking for something quite different, the Nothing Phone 2 is an option with its sleek appearance and flashy interface (literally, it flashes) — just know that it’s not fully compatible with Verizon’s network.\nUpdate, March 13th: Removed the 2022 iPhone SE and replaced it with the iPhone 16E.","summary":"Some of us take a kind of “I eat to live” rather than an “I live to eat” approach to gadgets.

Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of <em>Verge</em>-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or top-of-the-line offerings from iRobot, Dreame, and more.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"best-roborock-deals\">The best Roborock deals</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Roborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra</strong> — our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — is down to $1,099 ($700 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQLPNB2X\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/777nik4bpukfo\">Best Buy</a>, which matches its all-time low. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. That said, it’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23531209/roborock-s8-pro-robot-vacuums-price-specs-release-date-ces\"><strong>Roborock S8 Pro Ultra</strong></a>, which is almost identical to the aforementioned S8 MaxV, is currently matching its all-time low of $899.99 ($700 off) at <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-pro-ultra/\">Roborock’s online storefront</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pro-Ultra-Self-Washing-Self-Refilling-Self-Emptying/dp/B0BVB5PTDK/?tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=__vg0313awD__22761638__________________\">Amazon</a> when you clip the on-page coupon. The main difference is that the Ultra lacks an RGB camera — meaning it isn’t as good at avoiding obstacles — but that might be a positive if you prioritize privacy. It’s also limited to 8,000Pa of suction power and lacks a built-in voice assistant, as well as support for Matter.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Roborock S8 Plus</strong> is another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s available from <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-s8-plus\">Roborock</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-S8-Self-Empty-Ultrasonic-Detection/dp/B0BVB45FHV?th=1\">Amazon</a> (when you clip the on-page coupon) for $549.99 ($450 off), an all-time low. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It’s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though, you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space. </p>\n\n<p>The big-wheeled <strong>Roborock Q5 Pro</strong> is down to $179.99 ($250 off) at <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-q5-pro-robot-vacuum-and-mop\">Roborock’s online storefront</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/roborock-Q5-Pro-DuoRoller-Navigation/dp/B0C7VLHMQR\">Amazon</a> (with a coupon), which is $40 more than its all-time low. Not only is it one of the most affordable robovacs you can buy, but thanks to its dual rubber roller brushes and 5,500Pa of suction power, the entry-level Roborock model remains one of the best we’ve found at dealing with unwanted pet hair.</p>\n\n<p>The lidar-mapping Q5 Pro features voice controls, digital keep-out zones, and mopping pads with an onboard reservoir, but no self-cleaning functions. This particular SKU doesn’t include a self-emptying base, but the 770ml dust bin is one of the largest you’ll find, so you can go a few weeks without touching it. That being said, Roborock sells a version with a self-emptying dock, which is also <a href=\"https://us.roborock.com/products/roborock-q5-pro-plus-robot-vacuum-and-mop-with-auto-empty-dock\">on sale right now for $359.99</a> ($340 off).</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KkTLAn\">The best Dreame deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Dreame X40 Ultra</strong> is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $999.99 ($500 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Removable-SideBrush-Extensive-Auto-Empty/dp/B0CXDXKSXP\">Amazon</a> and from <a href=\"https://www.dreametech.com/products/dreametech-x40-ultra-robot-vacuum\">Dreame</a>. You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.</p>\n\n<p>The Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>Dream L20 Ultra</strong> is on sale for a new low of $599.99 ($400 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dreame-Mop-Extend-Self-Emptying-Self-Refilling-Avoidance/dp/B0CC236CLT\">Amazon</a>. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair. The only other real advantage the X40 holds over the L20 is its self-extending arms for vacuuming (though the dual mop pads can extend a bit for baseboard and corner coverage), nor does it have dirt detection.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The L20 Ultra’s base station is rather large, but it can take care of the entire cleaning process, including emptying the dustbin, emptying and refilling the water tanks, and washing and drying the mop pads. It doesn’t have a heated cleaning function for the mop pads, however. It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"the-best-switchbot-deals\">The best SwitchBot deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>SwitchBot S10</strong> is on sale for a new low of $499.99 ($700 off) at <a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-floor-cleaning-robot-s10\">SwitchBot’s online storefront</a> right now. The S10 is one of the most affordable robot vacuum / mop hybrids you can buy, one that can refill its own tank so long as you hook the battery-powered base station into your home’s plumbing. It can also dry its own mop pads and empty its own bin at a separate docking bay, and offers enough capacity to run for up to 90 days without intervention.</p>\n\n<p>The S10’s self-cleaning roller mop is more effective than the typical pads we see in most other units, but it’s also limited to a smaller coverage area. It only has a single roller brush for vacuuming, but its respectable 6,500Pa suction can make up for it. And while it has lidar mapping and AI-powered obstacle avoidance, we found it still has a tendency to get stuck on laundry, bath mats, and other obstacles. The S10 is also one of the few <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125273/switchbot-robot-vacuum-matter-support\">robovacs with Matter support</a>, however, which effectively enables native control through Apple Home, Google Home, and Alexa (though said platforms don’t yet fully support robot vacuums).</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"5ticpp\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24144618/switchbot-s10-review-robot-vacuum\">Read our SwitchBot S10 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The <strong>SwitchBot K10 Plus</strong> is available for an all-time low of $199.99 ($200 off) from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SwitchBot-Self-Empty-Navigation-Compatible-Connected/dp/B0CHBC7BW1\">Amazon</a> when you clip the on-page coupon, or directly from <a href=\"https://us.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-mini-robot-vacuum-k10/\">SwitchBot</a> for the same price with promo code <strong>LMTM120</strong>. At 3.6 inches high and 9.8 inches wide, it’s a more petite option if you want something that can maneuver tighter spaces, which it does to decent success with a lidar-based mapping system that supports digital keep-out zones. It only has 2,500Pa suction, but that should be powerful enough to lift dirt in all but the deepest carpeting. You can also attach disposable mopping pads, though its mopping function doesn’t work well. The K10 Plus comes with a self-emptying dock that can hold a respectable four liters of dirt before it needs emptying.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"KkTLAn\">More robot vacuum deals</h2>\n\n<p>The <strong>Yeedi Cube</strong> is currently down to an all-time low of $299.99 ($260 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Yeedi-Washing-Emptying-Obstacle-Climbing/dp/B0CDX5QL9T\">Amazon</a> when you clip the on-page coupon for $190 off.

The Cube uses lasers for object avoidance, too, though it’s not as effective for navigation as those with lidar and AI smarts. It can avoid large furniture and other objects, but it might need your help rerouting around cables, toys, and laundry. Still, we found it navigates better than most other robots under $300.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","contentSnippet":"A number of Roborock models are on sale right now, including the excellent S8 MaxV Ultra. | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n\nWe’re in an age where you can realistically delegate tasks to smart hunks of metal, whether it’s a self-driving car or a robot that can clean on your behalf. Most of us probably won’t be able to afford the helpful sentient humanoids being developed in our lifetimes, but robot vacuums are an affordable way to experience that promised utopia right now.\nToday’s floor cleaners are also more advanced than ever. In addition to vacuuming, many of the best models can now mop, allowing you to tackle both carpet and hardwood flooring. Some can automatically dispense of their trash and dirty water, too, and clean their own components without intervention. Soon, we’ll even have models that can pick up dirty laundry and purify the air in your home, preventing you from having to lift a finger.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Roborock deals\nThe best Dreame deals\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nMore robot vacuum deals\n\nBut if you need something relatively affordable for daily cleaning, you’d be surprised how little you have to pay for premium features. Below, we’ve listed the best deals currently available on a slate of Verge-approved robot vacuums, whether you prefer a budget entry-level model from Yeedi or top-of-the-line offerings from iRobot, Dreame, and more.\nThe best Roborock deals\nRoborock’s S8 MaxV Ultra — our pick for the best robot vacuum overall — is down to $1,099 ($700 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, which matches its all-time low. The combination of a 10,000Pa suction power and dual rubber roller brushes makes it a terrific vacuum, one that can easily pick up pet hair and other debris. It can also mop with great efficiency thanks to a sonic mopping system that vibrates the mop pad 4,000 times a minute, allowing it to clean sticky juices, thick condiments, and other common spills. The mop arm can extend to cover corners and baseboard edges, too.\nThe S8 MaxV Ultra’s camera-equipped AI obstacle avoidance makes it the best navigator in Roborock’s lineup and one of the top models overall, though it’s not quite as strong as Roomba’s. The mobile app offers ample options to customize cleaning zones and schedules, and you can use its dedicated voice assistant to start and stop routines. That said, it’s also a Matter-ready robot that’s compatible with Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home.\nThe Roborock S8 Pro Ultra, which is almost identical to the aforementioned S8 MaxV, is currently matching its all-time low of $899.99 ($700 off) at Roborock’s online storefront and Amazon when you clip the on-page coupon. The main difference is that the Ultra lacks an RGB camera — meaning it isn’t as good at avoiding obstacles — but that might be a positive if you prioritize privacy. It’s also limited to 8,000Pa of suction power and lacks a built-in voice assistant, as well as support for Matter.\nThe Roborock S8 Plus is another great robot vacuum / mop hybrid that’s available from Roborock and Amazon (when you clip the on-page coupon) for $549.99 ($450 off), an all-time low. It offers a vibrating mop pad that scrubs floors well, and, like the S8 MaxV Ultra, it features dual rubber roller brushes. It’s not as powerful as the MaxV Ultra given its 6,000Pa of suction, but it still does a good job of sucking up dirt from carpets. It also lacks a water tank, though, you do get good obstacle detection and a smaller auto-empty dock that saves space. \nThe big-wheeled Roborock Q5 Pro is down to $179.99 ($250 off) at Roborock’s online storefront and Amazon (with a coupon), which is $40 more than its all-time low. Not only is it one of the most affordable robovacs you can buy, but thanks to its dual rubber roller brushes and 5,500Pa of suction power, the entry-level Roborock model remains one of the best we’ve found at dealing with unwanted pet hair.\nThe lidar-mapping Q5 Pro features voice controls, digital keep-out zones, and mopping pads with an onboard reservoir, but no self-cleaning functions. This particular SKU doesn’t include a self-emptying base, but the 770ml dust bin is one of the largest you’ll find, so you can go a few weeks without touching it. That being said, Roborock sells a version with a self-emptying dock, which is also on sale right now for $359.99 ($340 off).\nThe best Dreame deals\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra is another mopping robot, and while it’s on the more expensive side, you can currently pick it up for $999.99 ($500 off) at Amazon and from Dreame. You’re paying a premium for 12,000Pa of suction power and a pair of removable, self-retracting mop pads, which it can automatically clean and dry on its own using the included base. It can also empty its own bin and refill its own water tank.\nThe Dreame X40 Ultra features an extendable side brush and mop pads, too, offering better coverage for baseboards, corners, and the underside of your furniture. It uses a combination of AI-powered cameras and “3D-structured light” (presumably based on lidar technology) to map and navigate rooms, with customizable keep-out zones and more functions available in the app. There’s also a dirt detection system that can identify messier spills and adjust its cleaning routine accordingly.\nThe Dream L20 Ultra is on sale for a new low of $599.99 ($400 off) at Amazon. The L20 Ultra is an excellent alternative to Dreame’s newer flagship robots, including the X40. It lacks a bit of power in comparison, though its 7,000Pa of suction power is still enough for most cleaning jobs. It also doesn’t have the L40’s tri-cut brush, which makes the step-up model more efficient at picking up pet hair.

It uses a lidar-based AI-powered navigation system, and you can prompt it to start cleaning by voice using Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\nThe best SwitchBot deals\nThe SwitchBot S10 is on sale for a new low of $499.99 ($700 off) at SwitchBot’s online storefront right now.
