These switches listened for a 198 kHz signal from the BBC's Radio 4 Long Wave service, primarily broadcast from the powerful Droitwich Transmitting Station. These switches listened to 30 messages per minute, waiting for a certain 50-bit data packet to arrive that signaled that electricity was now at cheaper, off-peak rates (\"tariffs\" in the UK).\nWith this over-the-air notice, homes that bought into Economy 7 or Economy 10 (7 or 10 hours of reduced-price power) could make use of ceramic-stuffed storage heaters that stayed warm into the day, prepare hot water heaters, and otherwise make use of off-peak power. How the electrical companies, BBC, and meters worked together is fascinating in its own right and documented in a recent video by Ringway Manchester (which we first saw at Hackaday).\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kevin Purdy\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/powerful-programming-bbc-controlled-electric-meters-are-coming-to-an-end/#comments","content":"\n            Customers are being pushed to smart meters that have their own signal problems.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Customers are being pushed to smart meters that have their own signal problems.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/powerful-programming-bbc-controlled-electric-meters-are-coming-to-an-end/","categories":["Tech","BBC","BBC Radio","bbc radio 4","long wave radio","radio signals","radio teleswitch service"],"isoDate":"2025-04-11T17:43:27.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","title":"Apple silent as Trump promises “impossible” US-made iPhones","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/apple-silent-as-trump-promises-impossible-us-made-iphones/","pubDate":"Fri, 11 Apr 2025 17:32:16 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Despite a recent pause on some tariffs, Apple remains in a particularly thorny spot as Donald Trump's trade war spikes costs in the tech company's iPhone manufacturing hub, China.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/11/apple-left-without-life-raft-amid-trumps-china-trade-war-analysts-.html\">Analysts predict</a> that Apple has no clear short-term options to shake up its supply chain to avoid tariffs entirely, and even if Trump grants Apple an exemption, iPhone prices may increase not just in the US but globally.</p>\n<p>The US Trade Representative, which has previously <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/23/apple-tariff-waiver-for-apple-watch-approved.html\">granted Apple an exemption</a> on a particular product, did not respond to Ars' request to comment on whether any requests for exemptions have been submitted in 2025.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/apple-silent-as-trump-promises-impossible-us-made-iphones/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/apple-silent-as-trump-promises-impossible-us-made-iphones/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ","content:encodedSnippet":"Despite a recent pause on some tariffs, Apple remains in a particularly thorny spot as Donald Trump's trade war spikes costs in the tech company's iPhone manufacturing hub, China.\nAnalysts predict that Apple has no clear short-term options to shake up its supply chain to avoid tariffs entirely, and even if Trump grants Apple an exemption, iPhone prices may increase not just in the US but globally.\nThe US Trade Representative, which has previously granted Apple an exemption on a particular product, did not respond to Ars' request to comment on whether any requests for exemptions have been submitted in 2025.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/apple-silent-as-trump-promises-impossible-us-made-iphones/#comments","content":"\n            How does Apple solve a problem like Trump’s trade war?\n          ","contentSnippet":"How does Apple solve a problem like Trump’s trade war?","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/apple-silent-as-trump-promises-impossible-us-made-iphones/","categories":["Policy","apple","china","china tariffs","Donald Trump","Foxconn","iphone","tariffs","Tim Cook","us","us-china trade war"],"isoDate":"2025-04-11T17:32:16.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","title":"A guide to the “platonic ideal” of a Negroni and other handy tips","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/is-there-a-grand-unified-theory-of-cocktails-maybe/","pubDate":"Fri, 11 Apr 2025 16:53:16 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Kevin Peterson is a \"nose\" for his own perfume company, <a href=\"https://sfumatofragrances.com\">Sfumato Fragrances</a>, by day.
