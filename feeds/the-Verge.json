We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23500640/garmin-venu-sq-2-review-smartwatch-fitness-tracker\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read our full review</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\" id=\"other-verge-favorites\">Other <em>Verge</em> favorites</h2>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>We’ve said it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23642073/best-printer-2023-brother-laser-wi-fi-its-fine\">several</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24117976/best-printer-2024-home-use-office-use-labels-school-homework\">times</a> before, but if all you need is a basic monochrome laser printer, just buy whatever Brother model is on sale. Right now, that’s the <strong>Brother HL-L2400D</strong> <strong>printer</strong>, which is matching its all-time low of $99.99 ($20 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPLF5VP5/\">Amazon</a> as part of the retailer’s spring sales event. It’s not really suited for photo use or anything fancy, but it connects to Wi-Fi, works reliably, and lasts ages on a single toner cartridge. It also supports automatic duplex printing, so, you know, it has that going for it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>We like Hoto’s svelte toolkits for a couple of reasons. They strike a minimalistic look, for one thing, and they incorporate at least one power tool. The company’s <strong>Drill Tool Set</strong> — which is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09YTNLDJG\">Amazon</a> for a new low of $159.58 ($40 off) — is no exception, as it comes with a power drill, a bunch of bits, and several other handy tools.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Pet owners who strive to keep pet hair to a minimum shouldn’t overlook the <strong>ChomChom Roller</strong>, especially since it&#8217;s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00BAGTNAQ\">Amazon</a> for $19.59 ($5 off). This simple tool can de-fur your couch faster and more effectively than most vacuums, even if it’s not the best tool for ridding clothes of unwanted hair.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Blue Yeti microphone</strong> is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LY6Z2M6/\">Amazon</a> in a myriad of colors starting at $89.99 ($40 off). That’s not the lowest price we’ve seen — it’s fallen to around $70 in the past — but it’s still a good deal on what has become a certifiable classic USB mic in the era of never-ending Zoom meetings. The versatile mic is easy to set up and simple to use, with a three-capsule microphone that can capture clear, warm sound that should appeal to both amateur podcasters and anyone wanting a more professional setup.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>One of our go-to gift guide picks, the <strong>Instant Pot Duo Plus</strong>, is currently available for an all-time low of $89.95 ($40 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NBKTPTS\">Amazon</a>. Multiple <em>Verge</em> staffers swear by the six-quart multi-cooker, which is similar to the base-model instant pot but comes with a few additional smart programs, including a customizable sous vide setting and a cake option that lets you pressure cook at high temperature for 40 minutes. That’s in addition to the ability to cook rice, steam veggies, and sauté, among other actions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you’re someone who owns (or, someday, envisions owning) USB-C gadgets that draw a lot of power, it’s wise to buy cables with high wattage passthrough, just so you’re ready for the future. <strong>Anker’s six-foot 240W USB-C cable</strong> is a great candidate, especially since it’s discounted to $16.99 ($8 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZ43567W?th=1\">Amazon</a>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ugreen’s Uno lineup of charging accessories aims to be more personable.

One of its most stunning lights, the <strong>Smart Table Lamp 2</strong>, is on sale for $55.99 ($14 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D41XL87F\">Amazon</a>. It can provide vibrant lights for a gathering, or you can adjust its color temperature to suit your bedtime and wake-up rituals better.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Having access to clean drinking water everywhere you are is a privilege, but not guaranteed. If you’ll be out in the wild, or if you’re vacationing but want to be cautious when it comes to water intake, the <strong>LifeStraw Peak</strong> is worth picking up at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SBPWHS7/\">Amazon</a> for its current price of $18.62 ($6 off).

It’s basically a lighter, more self-contained version of the original AeroPress, which has become a well-known staple amongst <em>Verge </em>staffers. It’s a simple way to make great coffee on the go, especially since it comes with a filter holder, a scoop, a mug, and other accessories designed to make life a little easier.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Power banks with built-in USB-C cables are the hot thing right now.

The Big Spring Sale, as it is known, is live, and runs through Monday, March 31st, bringing with it a slew of discounts on gardening supplies, bedding, and other necessities. While the discounts aren’t as steep as during tentpole events like Prime Day or even Amazon’s October event, you can still find steep savings on security cameras, headphones, smartwatches, and loads of other tech.\nWe’ve dug into all the deals and discounts available so far, the best of which you’ll find below. By and large, most of the deals will last until the end of the event. And, while having a Prime subscription means your packages will certainly arrive more quickly, you don’t necessarily need to be a member to get in on these tried-and-tested Verge favorites. We’ll also be keeping an eye on deals at competing retailers, including Best Buy, Walmart, and Target.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured deals\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nSmart home deals\nTablet and e-reader deals\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nOther Verge favorites\n\nFeatured deals\nHeadphone and earbud deals\nThe Beats Studio Pro are on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $179.95 ($170 off), which remains one of the best prices we’ve seen. Looks-wise, they’re not drastically different than prior Beats models, though they tack on a useful transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, and lossless playback over USB-C. Plus, unlike most noise-canceling headphones, they offer native support for both iOS and Android software features. Read our review.\nIf you prefer a pair of noise-canceling earbuds that support native software features on both iOS and Android, the Beats Studio Buds Plus are available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for around $130 ($40 off), nearly matching their best price to date. Yes, their lack of wireless charging and in-ear detection stings a bit at their typical list price, but their see-through design is slick enough that the shortcomings are (almost) forgivable. Read our review.\nIf you’re not dead set on noise cancellation but would still like a pair of Apple earbuds, the recently released AirPods 4 are matching their all-time low of $99.99 ($30 off) at Amazon and Walmart right now. They’re a substantial upgrade over the prior model when it comes to call clarity and sound, and they offer the same seamless integration with macOS, iOS, and tvOS as the rest of Apple’s earbuds. Read our review.\nThe Bowers & Wilkins Px7 S2e — aka, the best-sounding wireless headphones you can buy — are available at Amazon starting at $296.71 (about $102 off), or from Bower & Wilkins or Best Buy for $319.99 ($80 off). The British audio brand isn’t as well-known as Sony or Bose, though with the S2E, you’re getting superb sound, superior build quality, and controls that rely on physical buttons as opposed to the tap/swipe gestures found on mainstream noise-canceling headphones like Sony’s XM5. Read our review.\nAnker’s Soundcore Sport X20 earbuds are on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart for $63.99 ($16 off), matching their second-best price to date. The fitness-friendly buds are a lot like the Sport X10 — which were once our favorite budget earbuds for the gym — only they offer longer battery life, a more robust IP68 water resistance rating, and multipoint support. They also supposedly offer better noise cancellation and continue to sport an adjustable ear hook, which is a boon if you’re someone who struggles with keeping traditional earbuds in during intense gym sessions.\nSpeaker and soundbar deals\nJBL’s Charge 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart in multiple colors starting at $119.95 ($60 off), which is the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker since July. We’re not huge fans of the oversized JBL logo, but the powerful Bluetooth speaker hits all the right marks when it comes to functionality and performance, offering an impressive 20 hours of battery life and a built-in USB-A port that lets you top off your phone while listening to music.\nDespite the fact the Sonos app has been a bit of a debacle as of late, I have few qualms about recommending the Sonos Era 100 for $199 ($50 off), its current price at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sonos’ online storefront. It’s a great smart speaker with stereo sound, privacy-conscious microphone controls, and support for both Bluetooth and line-in connections. It can also connect to Spotify and every other music service you can think of and supports AirPlay 2, letting you stream content from Apple devices. Read our review.\nAmazon’s latest Echo Dot is down to $39.99 ($10 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and Kohl’s. The tiny, orb-shaped smart speaker features onboard microphones and produces good sound for its size, making it a solid option for listening to music, issuing smart home commands, checking the weather, and making other various Alexa requests. It also includes a built-in temperature sensor, which can tell you the temperature in the room and trigger various Alexa Routines, if necessary. Read our review.\nSony’s SRS-XB100 speaker is available at Amazon and Best Buy for around $48 ($12 off) or at Target for $39.99 if you’re a member of the retailer’s free loyalty program. Despite the fact it’s tiny, the Bluetooth speaker delivers crisp, clear sound along with up to 16 hours of continuous battery life. It also sports IP67 dust and water resistance, so you can take it hiking or to the pool without worrying. Read our review.\nWant a compact smart display for your nightstand? Amazon’s latest Echo Show 5 is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo for $69.99 ($20 off), which is a pretty typical discount. The Alexa-enabled smart display is Amazon’s smallest at 5.5 inches, though it’s still plenty big enough for managing smart home devices and controlling music playback. It also has a 2-megapixel camera (with an integrated privacy shutter), just in case you want to use it for more than a smart alarm clock.\nSmart home deals\nRing’s latest Indoor Cam is on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and The Home Depot for $39.99 ($20 off), matching its second-best price to date. The 1080p security camera boasts all the same features as the prior model — including two-way talk, color night vision, and a built-in siren — only it’s equipped with a redesigned mount that makes it easier to adjust. That said, you’ll need a Ring Protect Plan ($4.99 a month / $49.99 a year) to share or view video recordings.\nVerge smart home reviewer Jennifer Pattison Tuohy recommends the Roborock Q5 Pro for those who want a budget-friendly robot vacuum that’s skilled in the arcane art of sucking up pet hair. Fortunately, the Q50 Pro Plus model is on sale at Amazon with its auto-empty bin for just $299.99 ($400 off) — a $70 upcharge on the standard Q50 Pro that’s well worth it if your space has a lot of fur to sweep up.\nYou can grab a four-pack of Meross Smart Plug Minis on sale at Amazon for just $31.99 ($15 off), an all-time low. That brings the handy, hubless smart plugs down to just $8 a pop, allowing you to control a range of traditional devices via Apple Home, Google Home, or Amazon Alexa without breaking the bank.\nTablet and e-reader deals\nAmazon’s ad-supported Fire HD 10 tablet is on sale at Amazon and Best Buy right now with 32GB of storage starting at $94.99 ($45 off), or about $20 shy of its lowest price to date. The 2023 model sports USB-C charging, a 10.1-inch, 1080p display, and 3GB of RAM, which is plenty if all you’re doing is streaming or browsing. Just be aware that, like all of Amazon’s budget-minded tablets, it’s really focused on serving up Amazon content at every turn.\nIf you prefer a big-screen, note-taking alternative to the Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Colorsoft, the 2024 Kindle Scribe is matching its all-time low of $324.99 ($75 off) at Amazon and Best Buy with 32GB of storage. It remains the biggest Kindle available thanks to its 10.2-inch 300 ppi display, which features a textured cover that makes it feel more akin to writing on paper. The latest model offers a host of new writing features, too, including a tool that lets you jot notes directly in your book. Read our review.\nSmartwatch and fitness tracker deals\nAmazon and Walmart are both selling the Garmin Venu Sq 2 starting at around $187 ($62 off), which matches its second-best price to date. Although not originally priced as such, it’s considered an entry-level fitness watch for Garmin fans. It’s pretty stylish, overall, and can last just as long and do just as much as a Fitbit (if not more). We also like it for its wide breadth of health and workout-tracking features, along with its support for built-in GPS and contactless payments. Read our full review.\nOther Verge favorites\nWe’ve said it several times before, but if all you need is a basic monochrome laser printer, just buy whatever Brother model is on sale.
