This article also previously implied that Super Bowl LVII was only available to stream on paid streaming services; Fox also made it available for free on the Fox Sports app.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/15/24344628/super-bowl-lix-tubi-stream-free-fox","isoDate":"2025-01-15T20:54:29.000Z"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","link":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals","pubDate":"2025-01-15T20:45:12.000Z","author":"Quentyn Kennemer","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"A professional photographer editing images on a 16-inch MacBook Pro at a wedding.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lCNGdmXODWmkUKFoFjjCXTGioEA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/247412_Apple_MacBook_Pro_16_M4_Max_ADiBenedetto_0014.79.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption><em>MacBooks are almost always on sale, including newer M4 models.</em> | Photo by Antonio G.

Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal on more recent models is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><div id=\"bQleYo\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:11906226\"></div></div></div>\n<p id=\"7QDx7u\">Although Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac&amp;subid1=vergedeals030724\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.</p>\n<p id=\"W2m23B\">But if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.</p>\n<div><aside id=\"bbKdr5\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How does the Microsoft Surface Laptop stack up to the MacBook Air?\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24161123/microsoft-surface-vs-macbook-air-comparison\"},{\"title\":\"All of Apple’s Macs now start with 16GB of RAM\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270669/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-16gb-ram-doubled-apple-intelligence-ai\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<h2 id=\"EVXzol\">The best MacBook Air deals</h2>\n<h3 id=\"pEzsTQ\">M1 MacBook Air</h3>\n<p id=\"FJU3RG\">The<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon\"><strong>M1 MacBook Air</strong></a> was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. But while the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\">redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air</a> (which has been with us for a while as well) seems poised to take over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been fully dethroned in our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">guide to the best laptops</a>.</p>\n<p id=\"yzeZSS\">The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24101727/apple-m1-macbook-air-laptop-walmart\">committed to keeping it around</a> for the foreseeable future and is currently <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage%2F609040889&amp;subid1=vergedeals040224\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discounting it to $649</a> ($350 off) — a special sale price that’s hung around since the retailer ran its counter-Prime Day promotions in July. The M1 Air may be a few years old now, but it’s still hard to beat in terms of value, especially when it comes to everyday performance and battery life. </p>\n<div id=\"iF2kto\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:9737407\"></div></div>\n<h3 id=\"3VqFgR\">M2 MacBook Air</h3>\n<p id=\"OFnopX\">The M2 MacBook Air is a super slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor didn’t kick-start a revolution like the M1 generation, it’s a great performer for any user, including more demanding creatives.</p>\n<p id=\"8wY2P7\">It does have some slight downsides, though, including <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/1/23191141/apple-macbook-pro-13-m2-base-model-slow-device\">slower storage in the base 256GB configuration</a> and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\">best laptops</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"Tzj5E0\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The MacBook Air gets a surprise upgrade to 16GB of RAM \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged\"},{\"title\":\"The Mac turns 40 —&amp;nbsp;and keeps on moving\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24048479/apple-mac-40-anniversary\"},{\"title\":\"How to configure and use hot corners on macOS\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24025728/hot-corners-macos-how-to\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"sfB6ZF\">The <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/laptop-review/23207440/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review\"><strong>M2-powered MacBook Air 13</strong></a> from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23757441/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-2023-review\">15-inch version</a> waning. However, you can get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0DLHT9VXW?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://howl.link/wu6vd863qyqe0\">Best Buy</a> for $799 ($200 off).

You can still pick up the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD at retailers like <a href=\"https://howl.link/grgdwe7303n8t\">Best Buy</a> for $1,299 — or $1,234.05 (about $65 off) if you’re a member of My Best Buy Plus or Total.

Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13- and 15-inch variants simultaneously this time, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282981/apple-macbook-air-m2-m3-16gb-ram-minimum-price-unchanged\">now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"NNsbFs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple MacBook Air M3 review: small upgrades\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review\"},{\"title\":\"How to set the default apps in macOS\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24153045/macos-default-apps-email-browser-how-to\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"u6YpSQ\">Right now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1860126-REG%2Fapple_mc8k4ll_a_13_macbook_air_m3.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a> in its new entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $999 ($100 off), which isn’t exactly a great deal given it’s been $156 cheaper before.

Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23949207/apple-macbook-pro-16-m3-max-review-price-specs\">the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model</a>, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.</p>\n<p id=\"np8SQE\">But rest assured, versions that actual humans buy now receive regular discounts.

Di Benedetto\n    \n\n  \nApple currently sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. It discontinued the M1 MacBook Air to make room for the latest models, but some retailers are still selling the last-gen laptop starting at $649 — a far cry from the $2,499 starting price of the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro. Purchasing a new MacBook can certainly be a pricey endeavor, but thankfully, finding a deal on more recent models is actually not that difficult. Apple has recently shaken up the starting RAM for several models, creating more options than ever before and resulting in steeper discounts on older models.\n\n\n\nAlthough Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it’s not uncommon to see various models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without waiting for the changing deal winds to blow your way. It’s also the only option to find certain SKUs of older models as Apple continues to move forward on newer releases. Apple’s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\nBut if you want to buy new and you’re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available.\n\n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\nM1 MacBook Air\nThe M1 MacBook Air was considered Apple’s entry-level laptop before the M3 model’s arrival prompted Apple to stop selling it directly in its online and brick-and-mortar stores. But while the redesigned M2 version of the MacBook Air (which has been with us for a while as well) seems poised to take over as the top value choice, the 2020 version with an M1 processor and fanless design remains available at some retailers as a solid budget option. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. For many people, the M1 Air still ticks the right boxes when it comes to performance and price, even if it’s long enough in the tooth to have been fully dethroned in our guide to the best laptops.\nThe base MacBook Air with the M1 chip comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It’s becoming harder to find in new condition, but Walmart has committed to keeping it around for the foreseeable future and is currently discounting it to $649 ($350 off) — a special sale price that’s hung around since the retailer ran its counter-Prime Day promotions in July. The M1 Air may be a few years old now, but it’s still hard to beat in terms of value, especially when it comes to everyday performance and battery life. \n\n\nM2 MacBook Air\nThe M2 MacBook Air is a super slim, lightweight laptop with a 1080p webcam and a handy magnetic charger that frees up one of its two USB-C ports. Although its M2 processor didn’t kick-start a revolution like the M1 generation, it’s a great performer for any user, including more demanding creatives.\nIt does have some slight downsides, though, including slower storage in the base 256GB configuration and a notch cutout in its otherwise excellent screen. But even so, Apple hasn’t offered a more travel-friendly laptop since the days of the polarizing 12-inch MacBook, and this prior-gen model was once good enough to top our list of the best laptops.\n\n\nThe M2-powered MacBook Air 13 from 2022 seems to be on its way out, with availability for the 15-inch version waning. However, you can get the 13-inch M2 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and an eight-core GPU at Amazon and Best Buy for $799 ($200 off). You can also get the 13-inch Air with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD at Amazon starting at $949 ($250 off); however, that’s a significant premium for a configuration that offers less RAM than the base model. \nIt’s a bit harder to find discounts on the 15-inch MacBook Air M2. You can still pick up the base model with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD at retailers like Best Buy for $1,299 — or $1,234.05 (about $65 off) if you’re a member of My Best Buy Plus or Total. That being said, you’d be better off going with a discounted M3 model.\n\n\nM3 MacBook Air\nThe M1 Air and its wedge had to perish for the M3 MacBook Air to exist. Apple’s updated entry-level laptops arrived in both 13- and 15-inch variants simultaneously this time, bringing with them slightly faster performance and a slate of minor upgrades. Apple added Wi-Fi 6E, for one, along with an additional Thunderbolt port that allows you to use two external displays when the lid is closed. They also continue to offer 18 hours of battery life and a MagSafe charging port, though the M3 Air starts at a slightly higher price than its predecessor at $1,099. That said, Apple recently discontinued the M3 MacBook Air with 8GB of RAM and now considers the 16GB / 256GB model as the starting configuration.\n\n\nRight now, the 13-inch M3 MacBook Air is on sale at Amazon and B&H Photo in its new entry-level configuration with an 8-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $999 ($100 off), which isn’t exactly a great deal given it’s been $156 cheaper before. You can also find a $200 discount on the 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model with a 10-core GPU, which drops it to $1,099 in select colors at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is $50 more than its all-time low.\nAs for the 15-inch MacBook Air M3, you can currently grab it with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage starting at $1,189 ($110 off) at Amazon or $1,199 ($100 off) at B&H Photo. You can also get it in the 16GB / 512GB configuration at Amazon and B&H Photo starting at $1,299 ($200 off).\n\n\n\n\nThe best MacBook Pro deals\nDuring its “Scary Fast” event in 2023, Apple announced new MacBook Pros that use M3 processors — including a new 14-inch model that replaced the 13-inch M2 model. Apple followed the M3 models up with M4-based machines in October, and we’re already starting to see the discounts on them. That being said, the last-gen M3 models are often the better bargain, as they’re still relatively easy to find and receive steeper discounts.\nM3 and M3 Pro MacBook Pro\nThe entry point into the MacBook Pro world is a MagSafe-equipped MacBook Pro that uses the existing 14-inch design and slightly pares it down. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro has the same 3024 x 1964 resolution display and 120Hz refresh rate as its pricier siblings, and in addition to a MagSafe charging port, it has an SD card slot and HDMI port. However, it starts with just 8GB of RAM and lacks the third USB-C / Thunderbolt port found on the M3 Pro and M3 Max models (as well as Thunderbolt 4 speeds).\n\n\nThe M3 MacBook Pro may be a bit of an odd middle child in some ways, but it’s still a very good laptop — especially if you can find a deal that puts more price distance between the M3 model and the M3 Pro version. Availability for the base model with 8GB and 512GB of storage seems to be waning as Apple standardizes 16GB of RAM across its lineup.\nWe’re finding it challenging to find the base 16GB RAM / 512GB SSD model in stock, but if you don’t mind going with a reputable third-party seller, you can get one with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD starting at $1,349.95 (about $250 off) at Amazon. The model with 8GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is also on sale for $1,399 ($200 off) at Amazon and Best Buy, while the step-up configuration with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage is going for $1,499 ($200 off) at Best Buy.\n\n\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros of late 2023 are another round of spec-bump models, much like their previous 2022 incarnations. Now starting with the M3 Pro chip (or the speedier M3 Max) and 18GB of base RAM instead of 16GB, the new models remain targeted at creatives doing content work like video editing, photo processing, and other graphical work. Like their predecessors and the M1 Pro generation before that, they offer MagSafe charging, three USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI-out, and a full-size SD card slot, with prices starting at $1,999 for the 14-inch and $2,499 for the 16-inch. You can, of course, spec them up the wazoo if you’re willing to pay more, as exhibited by the review unit Apple sent us of the 16-inch model, which cost an eye-watering $7,199.\nBut rest assured, versions that actual humans buy now receive regular discounts. For instance, the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (11-core CPU / 14-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD is going for $1,599 ($400 off) at B&H Photo. It was $500 off not long ago, however, making the current discount good but not that good. You can also get the step-up model with 18GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD in space black for $1,999 ($400 off) at Amazon. \nAs for the base 16-inch Pro — which comes with an M3 Pro chip, 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD — it’s on sale starting at $2,099.99 (about $400 off) at Amazon, which is $100 more than the lowest price to date. B&H Photo is also selling the 16-inch M3 Pro model with 36GB of RAM and 512GB of storage for $2,499 ($400 off).\n\n\n\n\nM4 and M4 Pro MacBook Pro\nApple released the M4-series MacBook Pro on November 8th. Notably, the base 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro is the first to launch with 16GB of RAM — double the previous generation’s starting memory — and 512GB of storage for the same $1,599 starting price as the last-gen model. It also picks up a third Thunderbolt 4 port, which is positioned on the right side and supports dual external monitors while the lid is opened. Also new this year is an upgraded 12-megapixel webcam that supports Center Stage and a new Desk View feature, plus the option to add a nano-texture display for an extra $150. It’s also available in space black.\n\n\nThe 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M4 Pro and M4 Max chips also received additional RAM, bringing them up to 24GB. They start with 512GB of storage, too, and retail for $1,999 and $2,499, respectively. While the total port selection hasn’t changed compared to their respective M3 Pro and M3 Max counterparts, you’ll get faster Thunderbolt 5 ports on these more substantial models. That’s in addition to the SD slot, dedicated full-sized HDMI port, and 3.5mm jack. They also have the upgraded 12-megapixel Center Stage webcam with Desk View and the optional nano-texture display option.\nDeals for the M4 MacBook Pro have already started to roll in. Right now, for example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro M4 with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is down to $1,449 ($150 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is $51 more than its all-time low. You can also get it for $1,499 ($100 off) at Best Buy and save an extra $50 with a My Best Buy Plus or Total subscription. Meanwhile, the 24GB / 512GB variant with an M4 Pro chip (12-core CPU / 16-core GPU) is down to $1,799 ($200 off) at Amazon, Best Buy, and B&H Photo, which is $100 more than its best price to date. \nThe base 16-inch MacBook Pro is also on sale with an M4 Pro chip, 24GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $2,249 ($250 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, which is its typical sale price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Mac Mini deals\nThere’s a new Mac Mini in town, as M4-based models arrived earlier this year. Apple increased the starting RAM from 8GB to 16GB, as it did with the 2024 MacBook Pro and 2024 iMac. That makes Apple’s newest desktop an excellent value, even if you factor in the more aggressive discounts we’ve recently seen on the M2 Mac Mini.\nM2 and M2 Pro Mac Mini\nThe 2023 Mac Mini comes in a base configuration with Apple’s M2 processor or a more powerful configuration with the M2 Pro, both of which have proven to be some of Apple’s most value-packed computers to date. The M4 version is poised to take that crown, but the M2 Mac Mini is still kicking around and starts with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD for $599, while the M2 Pro model features a superior processor, gigabit ethernet, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $1,299.\nThe latter model also features an expanded port selection, from two USB-C ports to four. It’s almost like getting an M2 Pro-powered MacBook Pro 14 but in desktop form. However, keep in mind that buying any Mac Mini means you have to provide your own mouse, keyboard, and monitor. Right now, the base model with an M2 chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is down to $495 ($105 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo, or $499 ($100 off) at Best Buy. \n\n\nM4 and M4 Pro Mac Mini\nDeals on the last-gen Mac Mini are still available, sure, but we’re also starting to see discounts on the newest models. The M4 Mac Mini starts with an M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage for $599. That’s an incredible value for a tiny desktop computer that can rival the Mac Studio and Mac Pro when it comes to certain tasks, including light gaming, 4K video editing, and 3D modeling. Vertically, the M4 Mac Mini is a fair bit thicker than the M2 model at 2 inches tall, yet it measures a mere 5 inches wide and 5 inches deep.\nIn addition to the odd decision to place the power button on its underside, Apple moved the 3.5mm headphone jack and two of its five USB-C / Thunderbolt 4 ports to the front. The rear features an additional three thunderbolt ports, HDMI-out, and a gigabit ethernet port. You can also get the Mac Mini with an M4 Pro chipset starting at $1,399, which comes with faster Thunderbolt 5 storage and the option to upgrade to 10-gigabit ethernet for another $100.\n\n\nRight now, you can get the base Mac Mini at Amazon and B&H Photo with an M4 chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for $569 (about $30 off). (It’s also available at Best Buy for roughly the same price if subscribe to My Best Buy Plus or Total.)
