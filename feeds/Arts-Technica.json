Each can autonomously browse the web and other online sources to compile research reports in document format, and open source clones of the technique have debuted as well.\nNow, Anthropic is taking its Research feature a step further. The upgraded mode enables Claude to conduct \"deeper\" investigations across \"hundreds of internal and external sources,\" Anthropic says. When users toggle the Research button, Claude breaks down complex requests into smaller components, examines each one, and compiles a report with citations linking to original sources.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Benj Edwards\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/claudes-ai-research-mode-now-runs-for-up-to-45-minutes-before-delivering-reports/#comments","content":"\n            New feature searches hundreds of sources to build a document—but is it accurate?\n          ","contentSnippet":"New feature searches hundreds of sources to build a document—but is it accurate?","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/claudes-ai-research-mode-now-runs-for-up-to-45-minutes-before-delivering-reports/","categories":["AI","Biz & IT","AI agents","AI research agents","Anthropic","Anthropic Claude","ChatGPT","chatgtp","Claude","Deep Research","google","large language models","machine learning","openai"],"isoDate":"2025-05-02T16:39:26.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ryan Whitwam\n        ","title":"Google teases NotebookLM app in the Play Store ahead of I/O release","link":"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/05/google-finally-reveals-notebooklm-android-app-but-you-cant-use-it-yet/","pubDate":"Fri, 02 May 2025 16:24:15 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>After several years of escalating AI hysteria, we are all familiar with Google's desire to put Gemini in every one of its products.
