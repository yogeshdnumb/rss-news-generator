Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#Y5l6zo\">The best Apple Watch Series 9 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#6O6HRb\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#zdhvKu\">The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#MpVWgd\">A note on the more premium models</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch\">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s get to the deals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p>\n\n<p>While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Series 9</a>. That being said, it’s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11385157008\">Walmart</a> right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ3WKR6/\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11363523950\">Walmart</a> starting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen — while the LTE models can be had at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-Cellular-42mm-Jet-Black-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-S-M/11385820757\">Walmart</a> starting at $399 ($100 off).</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"D9WbpN\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read our Apple Watch Series 10 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Y5l6zo\">The best Apple Watch Series 9 deals</h2>\n\n<p>In 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen&nbsp;S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.</p>\n\n<p>The Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but specific configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale in the 41mm configuration at <a href=\"https://howl.link/f0dz5i8bexyby\">Best Buy</a> starting at $279.99 ($119 off) and in the 45mm configuration at <a href=\"https://howl.link/iwhrmqel90uro\">Best Buy</a> starting at $300.99 (about $128 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1D7GZC\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Read our Apple Watch Series 9 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6O6HRb\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23328608/apple-watch-se-new-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date\">received a refresh in late 2022</a>. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon and Walmart right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which remains its second-best price to date. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon and Walmart starting at $359 ($70 off) — which is also the second-best price we’ve seen — while the LTE models can be had at Walmart starting at $399 ($100 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.\nThe Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but specific configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale in the 41mm configuration at Best Buy starting at $279.99 ($119 off) and in the 45mm configuration at Best Buy starting at $300.99 (about $128 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.\nRead our Apple Watch Series 9 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\nAt the moment, the best deals on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon and Walmart, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $199 ($50 off). The 44mm configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon and Walmart for $229 (also $50 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 44mm model is currently on sale at Walmart starting at $229 ($100 off), or in the smaller 40mm sizing at Walmart and Amazon starting at $249 ($50 off).\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra.

Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon with a Trail Loop starting at $734.89 (about $64 off), or with an Alpine Loop or an Ocean Band starting at $769 ($30 off). You can also pick it up at Best Buy and Target starting at around $799, which is the standard retail price.\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium.
