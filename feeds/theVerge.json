The display is three-dimensional and includes speed, adaptive driving assistance information, stoplight and road sign information, navigation information, and state of charge. It’s customizable, too, allowing drivers to set up the information they want to have in their eyeline while on the road.</p>\n<p id=\"BYOXFp\">Unlike other HUDs, where you have to be at the right angle to see the information displayed, BMW says the new display will be visible to both the driver and passenger. </p>\n<p id=\"neP1mW\">BMW also integrated navigation and ADAS features in the HUD so that the path you’re following turns green when using onboard navigation with driver assist. “If you think about higher levels of automated driving,” Bauer said, “then ADAS and navigation naturally come together.” He also noted that many of the features of the new HUD came about thanks to customer feedback.

Users can drag and drop “pixels,” or apps that they use frequently, into a couple of main boxes on the home screen so they are more readily available. According to BMW, the company does have plans to offer a BMW app store for the new UX, which could include paid apps for things like special lighting packages, similar to Hyundai’s plans for the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24301740/hyundai-ioniq-9-three-row-electric-suv-laas\">Ioniq 9</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"EmlETD\">BMW says it’s using edge AI to “learn” from the customer as they drive and offer relevant features based on behavior. For example, if you frequently take a winding road home from work, put the vehicle into Sport mode, and cue up your music app, those options will regularly pop into the center screen for easy access. And if you frequently listen to meditation apps or podcasts while charging your EV, those apps will pop into the center stack whenever you’re plugged in.</p>\n<p id=\"aWAQ55\">BMW says it’s also using large language models to help make the vehicle smarter about what drivers want.

The Remarkable Paper Pro tablet uses a slower E Ink Gallery 3 screen, which can display over 50,000 colors using red, blue, yellow, and white ink particles.\nE Ink hasn’t revealed exactly how many different colors Spectra 6 can reproduce, but it relies on a six-color ink system adding green and black that pushes the gamut volume closer to 60,000. Because it can take several seconds to refresh the entire screen, Spectra 6 is better suited to devices like static digital displays like the InkPoster, instead of e-readers.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24328013/pocketbook-e-ink-sharp-inkposter-electronic-paper-spectra-6","isoDate":"2025-01-07T17:00:00.000Z"},{"title":"GE Cync’s new smart switches look better and work with Matter ","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338143/ge-cync-smart-switches-dimmers-matter-proseo-smart-shades-ces-2025-price-availability","pubDate":"2025-01-07T16:57:46.000Z","author":"Wes Davis","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Picture of the keypad dimmer next to its packaging.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yGbThR6n8bRf5Zy9pG43-Z1u2SE=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73832647/GE_Cync_keypad_dimmer.0.png\" />\n        <figcaption><em>The new Cync keypad dimmer looks very 1980s sci-fi control panel, and I’m here for it. </em> | Image: GE</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"YnT1Bl\">GE unveiled several new smart home products <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/savant-unveils-premium-ge-smart-lighting-and-shading-for-residential-pros-enhanced-ge-reveal-bulbs-new-cync-outdoor-lights-and-savant-smart-power-solution-at-ces-2025-302342306.html\">at CES on Monday</a>, including new Matter-compatible Cync smart switches, non-Matter Cync lighting, and upscale smart shades.

Di Benedetto / The Verge\n    \n\n  \nLenovo is trying an experiment. In May, it will officially become the very first company outside of Valve to ship a handheld gaming PC with the Steam Deck’s wonderfully pick-up-and-play SteamOS instead of Microsoft Windows. And at $499, it’ll be a true Steam Deck rival, joining it as one of the lower-priced PC handhelds you can buy.\n\n\nThat handheld will be the 1.6-pound Lenovo Legion Go S, a new and improved version of the company’s eight-inch handheld that ditches the Nintendo Switch-like detachable gamepads and kickstand for a lighter and more traditional design, with a sculpted grip that felt supremely comfortable in my hands. \n\n\nIt’ll also be one of the few handhelds on the market to offer a 120Hz variable refresh rate screen — a highly desirable feature that lets low-power handheld gameplay feel smooth, even if it’s not generating lots of frames. That screen will be lower in resolution at 1920 x 1200, too, and feature a hopefully power-sipping new AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip. (It’s a Lenovo-exclusive chip, by the way.)\n  \n \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n View this post on Instagram\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n\nA post shared by The Verge (@verge)\n\n\n\nIn other words, it might address every major complaint I had in my Legion Go review, while additionally adding fun configurable RGB lighting around the joysticks, a slightly larger 55Wh battery, a pair of levers to reduce the throw of the triggers, and a less obtrusive touchpad, too, while retaining the dual USB 4 ports.\nBut Lenovo isn’t going all in on SteamOS.

It starts out looking like a fairly unassuming 14-inch productivity laptop, albeit with a slightly square-ish aspect ratio and a resolution of 2000 x 1600. But hitting a dedicated key or raising your hand to the webcam activates the motors and makes the display climb to a tall 16.7 inches, with an extended resolution of 2000 x 2350. It took roughly 10 seconds for the ThinkBook’s screen to extend or contract, and while its motors aren’t egregiously loud, they’re noisy enough to draw attention in a quiet environment. That, and the fact that your laptop just freakin’ <em>grew</em> out of nowhere.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"8UkDT3\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Lenovo’s rollables are a compelling, unfinished pitch for the future\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/26/23615842/lenovo-rollable-laptop-smartphone-prototype-concept\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"FHCIGa\">The extra screen real estate in 16.7-inch mode is enough to fit two 16 x 9 windows stacked on top of each other. Going back to 14-inch mode tucks the bottom portion of the screen into the laptop chassis, where it hides below the keyboard deck and displays black pixels to not waste power. Reps from Lenovo, including Samuel Shang of Lenovo research, who worked on the ThinkBook’s development team, said the nested location of the screen and small size of the motors in the hinge allowed for ample battery capacity — which seems to track since the laptop’s 66Wh battery is pretty typical for a laptop of this size. Shang and  Lenovo product marketing’s Drupad Kandhi said the ThinkBook was thoroughly tested and rated for at least 30,000 closings and openings of its lid hinge and 20,000 rolls both up and down.</p>\n<div id=\"v6UWnh\"><div data-anthem-component=\"gallery:12524166\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"KgLerZ\">Watching the screen go up and down just didn’t get old in our short time testing it. By default, the ThinkBook plays a bright and colorful abstract animation of a flexible material coiling or unrolling while the screen rolls down or up. It’s a cute graphic that’s reminiscent of rolling homemade dough through a pasta machine, but you can thankfully turn it off and watch the display grow or shrink with your current window or app onscreen. I suspect part of the animation’s purpose is to distract from the little curls visible in the display, which are more obvious when it’s moving and there’s something darker onscreen like <em>The Verge</em>’s homepage.</p>\n<p id=\"JUpdL9\">The flexible OLED in the ThinkBook Plus is one of <a href=\"https://global.samsungdisplay.com/31326\">Samsung Display’s IT foldable</a> panels. Like the creases in folding phones, the ThinkBook’s screen has plenty of smaller creases along its lower half that you don’t really notice when using it — but look closely or stare at the screen from steeper angles, and they’re clear as day. You can see them in some of my photos, but I must concede that my bounced flash <em>really </em>illuminates the creases and makes them look more pronounced than they are with the naked eye.</p>\n<figure class=\"e-image\">\n        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gR4vZdokCEv9aTnpSfuwixW20OI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25820495/247466_CES_2025_Lenovo_ThinkBook_Plus_Gen6_rollable_laptop_ADiBenedetto_0005.jpg\">\n      <figcaption><em>What should we nickname this?
