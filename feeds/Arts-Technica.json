In theory, search engines can potentially change that. By prioritizing results from high-quality, credible sources, a search engine could ensure that people found accurate information more frequently, potentially opening them to the possibility of updating their beliefs.\nObviously, that hasn't worked out on the technology side, as people quickly learned how to game the algorithms used by search engines, meaning that the webpages that get returned have been created by people with no interest in quality or credibility. But a new study is suggesting that the concept fails on the human side, too, as people tend to devise search terms that are specific enough to ensure that the results of the search will end up reinforcing their existing beliefs.\nThe study showed that invisibly swapping search terms to something more general can go a long way toward enabling people to change their mind.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          John Timmer\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/weve-outsourced-our-confirmation-biases-to-search-engines/#comments","content":"\n            Forcing the use of general search terms can help people change their minds.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Forcing the use of general search terms can help people change their minds.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/weve-outsourced-our-confirmation-biases-to-search-engines/","categories":["Science","cognitive bias","confirmation bias","Human behavior","search engines"],"isoDate":"2025-03-25T19:41:11.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jon Brodkin\n        ","title":"FBI probes arson of Tesla cars and facilities, says “this is domestic terrorism”","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/fbi-probes-arson-of-tesla-cars-and-facilities-says-this-is-domestic-terrorism/","pubDate":"Tue, 25 Mar 2025 18:55:12 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation yesterday launched a task force \"to try to nail the criminals setting fire to Tesla vehicles and charging stations,\" and is looking into an anarchist blog that has been \"calling for more\" attacks, The New York Post <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2025/03/24/us-news/fbi-launches-task-force-to-nail-criminals-behind-fiery-tesla-attacks/\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p>\"The bureau has received reports of 48 instances so far this month related to Tesla vehicles, dealerships and charging stations and is investigating at least seven of them in conjunction with local law enforcement, The Post has learned,\" the article said. \"The agency's newly formed 10-person task force will deploy ATF personnel—special agents and intelligence analysts from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the Treasury Department—and personnel from the FBI's Counterterrorism Division, including its Domestic Terrorism Operations Section and Weapons of Mass Destruction.\"</p>\n<p>ATF is embedding personnel in some FBI field offices, starting in San Antonio, Texas, \"where some of the Molotov cocktail attacks have been carried out,\" the report said.

Not nearly as much as I expected, though, for the middle of February at the northern end of Sweden. I've flown here to drift electric Polestars on an icy lake called Stor-Skabram, near the small outpost of Jokkmokk, fully above the Arctic Circle.
