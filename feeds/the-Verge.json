As many legal experts have pointed out, those companies could face up to about $850 billion in potential penalties for violating the law — which was passed by a bipartisan Congress, signed by former President Joe Biden, and upheld by the entire Supreme Court. The government could act on any potential violation even five years after it happens — and an executive order doesn’t change that, though it might help give the companies a slightly better due process defense to fight it. Companies still might not risk litigation over such a large potential fine, though they may also be wary of raising Trump’s ire by refusing to work with TikTok.\nOn top of all this, the rule the order says it’s “not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States,” which makes it even less reliable as a defense for companies.\nTrump also declared on Sunday that the US government could own 50 percent of TikTok through an unexplained “joint venture” with a private company. It remains unclear how this would work.","id":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24348213/trump-tiktok-ban-executive-order-sale-delay-china","isoDate":"2025-01-21T01:28:19.000Z"},{"title":"Donald Trump pulls US out of Paris climate agreement","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/20/24345964/donald-trump-paris-climate-agreement-exit","pubDate":"2025-01-20T23:52:29.000Z","author":"Justine Calma","content":"  \n\n    <figure>\n      <img alt=\"Photo illustration of earth in a heating pot of water.\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBa_FPpCXFQ1L6fDrZs8ORnkXHg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/73858264/STK438_CLIMATE_CHANGE_A.0.jpg\" />\n        <figcaption>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n  <p id=\"HjJqz4\">Donald Trump has once again taken the US out of the landmark <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement\">Paris climate agreement</a>, abandoning the global effort to limit climate change.

The new TS-L2040 and TS-L1640 deliver even more magnification than Fujfilm’s previous top-of-the-line offering — 20x and 16x, instead of just 14x — while also being smaller and lighter without sacrificing features like waterproofing. Both new models can survive a complete dunking to a depth of one meter for 30 minutes.\nThe Fujifilm TS-L2040, with 20x magnification, will be $1,299.95 when available for purchase starting on January 31st, 2025. The slightly cheaper TS-L1640, which offer 16x magnification, will be $1,199.95.\nUsing binoculars with more than 10x magnification without a tripod or stable support can result in blurred images because humans are simply incapable of holding them steady enough by hand. Even imperceptible hand movements are exaggerated through a pair of binoculars, making it hard to focus on a distant magnified subject.\nImage: Fujifilm\n      Fujifilm’s new TS-L2040 Techno-Stabi binoculars (right) are smaller and lighter than the company’s previous flagship model (left) which weigh about a pound heavier.\n  \nFujifilm’s new models rely on a gimbal-mounted prism with plus and minus three degrees of electronic stabilization. They’re also noticeably smaller and lighter than the company’s existing Techno-Stabi TS-X14x40 binoculars — weighing 1.88 pounds instead of 2.9 pounds — making them easier for birdwatchers to carry on a hike.\nThe two new models aren’t entirely replacing Fujifilm’s heavier and bulkier TS-X14x40 binoculars.
