It stems from the Held v. Montana case in which 16 young people sued the state over its contributions to climate change, claiming its fossil fuel-centric approach to energy violated the state constitution’s guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment.” The plaintiffs won, and in December 2024, the Montana Supreme Court upheld their victory.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Nick Mott, Inside Climate News\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/montanas-republican-legislators-fight-back-after-successful-youth-climate-lawsuit/#comments","content":"\n            Republican backlash could lead to changes in Montana’s courts and environmental laws.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Republican backlash could lead to changes in Montana’s courts and environmental laws.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/montanas-republican-legislators-fight-back-after-successful-youth-climate-lawsuit/","categories":["Policy","climate change","climate lawsuit","montana","syndication"],"isoDate":"2025-04-29T17:40:46.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ryan Whitwam\n        ","title":"Google: Governments are using zero-day hacks more than ever","link":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/google-governments-are-using-zero-day-hacks-more-than-ever/","pubDate":"Tue, 29 Apr 2025 16:53:39 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Last year was big for zero-day exploits, security threats that appear in the wild before vendors have a chance to develop patches.
