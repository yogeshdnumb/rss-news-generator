Managing your limited ammo, health, and armor resources in Eternal meant expertly juggling a bewildering array of chainsaws, flamethrowers, grenades, and melee-based staggers into powerful, pre-animated \"glory kills.\" That was all on top of the frequent weapon-switching needed to take advantage of the weaknesses of the varied enemies surrounding you and the double-jump-and-dash movement system that required expert use of all three dimensions.\nSomething had to give. So for Doom: The Dark Ages, the team at id Software has committed to a more streamlined, back-to-basics system that limits complexity while maintaining the same overall difficulty level. That means a \"fewer strings on the guitar\" approach to controls that narrows almost every action down to just three context-sensitive buttons, as the developers discussed in a hands-off virtual preview session attended by Ars Technica.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kyle Orland\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/#comments","content":"\n            Preview: A more grounded game than <em>Doom Eternal</em> in more ways than one.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Preview: A more grounded game than Doom Eternal in more ways than one.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/","categories":["Gaming"],"isoDate":"2025-01-23T19:00:37.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","title":"Court rules FBI’s warrantless searches violated Fourth Amendment","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/court-rules-fbis-warrantless-searches-violated-fourth-amendment/","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Jan 2025 17:50:39 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>It's official: The FBI's warrantless searches of communications seized to protect US national security have at last been ruled unconstitutional and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>In a major December <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/US-v-Hasbajrami-Ruling-1-21-25.pdf\">ruling</a> made public this week, US District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall settled one of the biggest debates about feared government overreach that has prompted calls to reform Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for more than a decade.</p>\n<p>Critics' primary concern was whether the FBI needed a warrant to search and query Americans' communications that are often incidentally, inadvertently, or mistakenly seized during investigations of suspected foreign terrorists.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/court-rules-fbis-warrantless-searches-violated-fourth-amendment/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/court-rules-fbis-warrantless-searches-violated-fourth-amendment/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ","content:encodedSnippet":"It's official: The FBI's warrantless searches of communications seized to protect US national security have at last been ruled unconstitutional and in violation of the Fourth Amendment.\nIn a major December ruling made public this week, US District Judge LaShann DeArcy Hall settled one of the biggest debates about feared government overreach that has prompted calls to reform Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) for more than a decade.\nCritics' primary concern was whether the FBI needed a warrant to search and query Americans' communications that are often incidentally, inadvertently, or mistakenly seized during investigations of suspected foreign terrorists.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/court-rules-fbis-warrantless-searches-violated-fourth-amendment/#comments","content":"\n            Rights groups demand lawmakers add a warrant requirement to Section 702.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Rights groups demand lawmakers add a warrant requirement to Section 702.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/court-rules-fbis-warrantless-searches-violated-fourth-amendment/","categories":["Policy","fbi","FISA","Fourth Amendment","national security","online privacy","section 702"],"isoDate":"2025-01-23T17:50:39.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Jon Brodkin\n        ","title":"Trump’s FCC chair gets to work on punishing TV news stations accused of bias","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trumps-fcc-chair-gets-to-work-on-punishing-news-stations-accused-of-bias/","pubDate":"Thu, 23 Jan 2025 16:52:08 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has revived three complaints against broadcast stations accused of bias against President Donald Trump.</p>\n<p>Outgoing Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel last week directed the FCC to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/departing-fcc-chair-rejects-complaints-about-tv-news-coverage-of-trump/\">dismiss the complaints</a> against CBS, ABC, and NBC stations, along with a fourth complaint about Fox, in what she called a stand for the First Amendment.
