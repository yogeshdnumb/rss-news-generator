But there is no requirement for a coupe to only have two doors: the name is derived from the French \"couper,\" meaning cut. And indeed, the roofline is cut down more than 2 inches lower than the actual 3 Series.\nThere's also a hatch at the rear, rather than a trunk lid. So, technically it's a fastback body style, which BMW has decided to call Gran Coupe the way it calls station wagons Tourings. Pedantic pigeonholing of body style will probably take a back seat to discussion of the front grille, though.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jonathan M.
