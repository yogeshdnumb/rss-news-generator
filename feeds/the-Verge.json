Are you trying to see how your sleep impacts your athletic performance? Hoping to mask the sound of a snoring partner? I’ve tested all sorts of sleep tech and can point you toward the right gadget for your sleep goal.</p>\n\n<p>One question to ask yourself is how well a device fits your lifestyle. If you want to monitor your trends, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">Oura Ring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22957195/whoop-review-fitness-tracker-wearables\">Whoop 4.0</a> have some of the most in-depth sleep and recovery tracking around. But these are devices with a singular focus. Busy folks might want something that’s also useful during the day. Smartwatches like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Pixel Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Apple Watch</a> will get you more utility for the price. On the other hand,<strong> </strong>there’s no point in wrist-based sleep trackers if you wake up in the middle of the night to take them off. If you can’t wear a watch, earbuds, or a ring to bed, you may want to look into non-invasive options like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23161678/withings-sleep-review-sleep-tracking\">Withings Sleep</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review\">Google Nest Hub</a>. And if you’re looking for earbuds to drown out noise,<strong> </strong>Anker’s Soundcore Sleep A20 buds are great for side sleepers and for folks who like to drift off to podcasts. Some more good news is three ex-Bose engineers have resurrected the Bose Sleepbuds — they’re <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24275875/ozlo-sleepbuds-hands-on-bose-wearables-sleep-tracking\">Ozlo Sleepbuds now</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\"><strong>Performance</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">A good sleep tech gadget doesn’t try to do too much at once. It ought to be excellent at addressing the main issue it’s trying to solve. The rest is gravy.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\"><strong>Value </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Sleep tech can be <em>expensive</em>.

Good sleep tech shouldn’t disturb your sleep. Is a tracker too bulky to be useful? Does a smart mattress cover feel lumpy?</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\"><div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-methodology-accordion-item\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-heading\"><strong>Context</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none c-methodology-accordion__item-content\">Data is useless without context.

You should be confident the device can last a whole night without dying. If it’s also a fitness gadget or wearable, it should be able to either last all day between charges or support fast charging so it doesn’t run out midday.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n<p>Sleep tech has come a long way in just a few short years, but these aren’t medical devices, so take their sleep tracking data <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/does-my-smartwatchs-sleep-tracker-actually-do-anything-1838290221\">with a grain of salt</a>. Gadgets like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price\">Withings ScanWatch</a>, Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 / Ultra, and Apple Watch Series 10 / Ultra 2 have FDA clearance for monitoring sleep disturbances. That doesn’t mean they can definitively diagnose you with sleep apnea. No matter how advanced the sensors are, or how many features a product may boast, trackers are meant to help spot when something’s off. Nothing more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Taking all that into consideration, I’ve compiled these recommendations based on how well a sleep gadget addresses the problems it’s trying to fix. We also considered comfort, accuracy, battery life, and whether it provides good context for its data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"xDJKMT\">The best sleep tracker</h2>\n\n<p>The $349 Oura Ring 4 isn’t a fitness tracker that happens to track sleep. It’s a sleep tracker that happens to track some fitness metrics. The ring has seven temperature sensors, a green LED sensor for measuring heart rate, and red and infrared LEDs to measure blood oxygen. That’s not including the battery or accelerometers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>All these sensors provide a holistic look at your recovery. Each morning, you’re given a report on your readiness, sleep quality, and activity goals for the day. These reports tell you how your sleep impacts your daily ability to take on stress, and whether you should take it easy or challenge yourself. The app also includes wellness features like guided meditations and white noise to help you fall asleep. Oura recently released <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">its fourth-gen model</a>, and over the past year or so, it has released several new features, including cardiovascular age and capacity, an AI-powered chatbot advisor, daytime stress, and resilience. If you use the Natural Cycles app for digital birth control or fertility planning, it can be used <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/2/23287187/natural-cycles-digital-birth-control-oura-temperature\">in lieu of a basal body thermometer</a> as well.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25739454/247314_Oura_Ring_4_AKrales_0048.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"Oura Ring 4 on its side in front of ceramic rabbit.\" title=\"Oura Ring 4 on its side in front of ceramic rabbit.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Oura Ring 4 has an improved algorithm and recessed sensors.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Of all the sleep gadgets I’ve tested, the Oura Ring has the best context for its data, which it presents in an intuitive way. Its version of blood oxygen monitoring is also preferable to the random spot checks found on devices like the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features\">Apple Watch</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7.</a> Instead, the Oura Ring passively monitors your blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels during sleep and encourages you to check your baseline over a long period of time. It’s not exciting, but it’s a more useful measure for the average person. The Oura is also one of the few devices to include a recovery mode. If you’re sick or injured, you can hit pause on your activity goals until you’re back to full health.</p>\n\n<p>But the main appeal here is the form factor: A ring is infinitely more comfortable than a watch. And although it’s not the most fashionable, it’s nondescript enough to wear to any event. Plus, you get up to a week on a single charge. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The only thing I don’t love is that it now comes with a $6 monthly subscription. You can at least save a bit on the hardware if you opt for the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker\">last-gen Oura Ring</a> while supplies last. However, if you’re truly passionate about monitoring your sleep and willing to commit long-term, it’s well worth the price.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"IfFynY\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24268024/oura-ring-4-review-smart-rings-wearables\">Read my review of the Oura Ring 4</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"MQI32U\">The best smartwatch with sleep tracking</h2>\n\n<p>The $349.99 <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> has come a long way since the original Pixel Watch launched. For sleep tracking, the most important improvements since launch are better battery life and an automatic Bedtime Mode that detects when you’ve fallen asleep.</p>\n\n<p>On the data side, the Pixel Watch also benefits from being a Fitbit smartwatch. Fitbit might be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23612141/fitbit-google-server-outage-challenges-wearables\">floundering a bit</a> these days, but it was early to sleep tracking and it shows. Of course, you get sleep stages, but you can also view how your sleep compares to other people of your age and sex. Like the Oura Ring, it eschews SpO2 spot checks for passive overnight tracking (via the Estimated Oxygen Variation metric) and also provides a Daily Readiness Score based on your long-term activity and sleep quality. Since launch, Google also added <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23758314/google-pixel-watch-blood-oxygen-heart-rate-fitbit\">nightly SpO2 percentages</a><strong> </strong>and Fitbit’s <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/15/23460193/pixel-watch-fitbit-sleep-tracking-google-wallet\">Sleep Profile feature</a> to the Pixel Watch. After 14 days of sleep data in a month, the following month you’ll be assigned a cute sleep animal based on your sleep habits. The idea is to help you better understand your circadian rhythms and how it impacts sleep.<strong> </strong>Fitbit Premium subscribers also get access to a ton of wellness content, if that’s your thing. Apple and Samsung are still catching up here in terms of accuracy, battery life, and the level of detail in their sleep metrics.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25610297/247234_Pixel_Watch_3_AKrales_0189.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613\" alt=\"The Google Pixel Watch 3 resting in an orange case box surrounded by other colorful boxes.\" title=\"The Google Pixel Watch 3 resting in an orange case box surrounded by other colorful boxes.\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Watch 3 also now comes in two sizes. This is the larger 45mm.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" data-portal-copyright=\"Image: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\" />\n<p>Compared to the Oura Ring, you’re going to get better exercise-tracking capabilities with the Pixel Watch’s built-in GPS. Although Oura has beefed up its exercise tracking, it’s still barebones. And the Pixel Watch is handier in day-to-day life because you can set silent alarms, use it for contactless payments, and receive notifications. It also supports Google Assistant.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re a Samsung user, you might want to consider a combo of a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24211888/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24210505/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables\">Galaxy Ring</a>. Together, they let you mitigate the watch’s not-so-great battery and rely instead on the Ring to get your sleep data more comfortably. Admittedly, this is an expensive route. Samsung’s accuracy isn’t quite as good as Fitbit’s, but the company’s fleshed out its advanced sleep features. <span>It, too, has a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/7/22921615/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-wear-os-google-assistant-wearables-smartwatch\" target=\"_blank\">sleep profile feature</a> that’s similar to Fitbit’s, though it arguably has a <a href=\"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23224858/Screen_Shot_2022_02_04_at_3.10.35_PM.png\" target=\"_blank\">better selection of cartoon animals</a>.</span> (Samsung’s sleep coach said I was a cautious deer but spiritually, I identify as a nervous penguin.) Another point in Samsung’s favor? It’s been continually improving its sleep tracking. Galaxy Watch users can now view sleep stats in more detail from the wrist. The new software will also introduce a tweaked Sleep Mode, which utilizes the invisible infrared sensor for tracking instead of the visible green LED sensor. Earlier this year, Samsung also added FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but you’ll need a Samsung phone to use that feature.</p>\n\n<p>Neither of these two Android-only watches is an option for iPhone users, of course. If you refuse the green bubble life, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23353756/apple-watch-series-8-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Apple Watch</a> is the best <em>smartwatch</em> overall but its native sleep-tracking features have a long way to go. If you’re set on having an Apple Watch, they’ll get you the basics, plus FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection with the Series 10 and Ultra 2, and you can set sleep schedules that sync with your phone’s Focus modes. However, if you want great sleep tracking <em>and</em> are dead set on an Apple Watch, you’re better off downloading a third-party sleep app or getting one of the other options in this buying guide.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"cDJdKL\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24239115/google-pixel-watch-3-review-smartwatch-wear-os-wearable\">Read my review of the Google Pixel Watch 3.</a></h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ZBGdQA\">The best sleep tracker for athletes</h2>\n\n<p>As far as recovery goes, no sleep tech gadget goes the extra mile for athletes quite like Whoop. It primarily tracks your body’s ability to take on cardiovascular strain, but its take on sleep is unique. Instead of focusing on sleep quality, it zeroes in on your sleep debt and whether the sleep you’re getting is enough to fuel your training.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>If you’re into scrutinizing how certain factors impact your sleep, Whoop is far ahead of the competition. You can log how anything from the COVID-19 vaccine to magnesium supplements affects your sleep. It’s not a necessary feature, but it’s a bonus if sleep journaling is important to you.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike with most modern wearables, you’ll get next to nothing in the way of notifications or smart features. However, that also means it’s got good battery life. The Whoop 4.0 also comes with a portable battery pack that slides onto the tracker itself.

Are you trying to see how your sleep impacts your athletic performance? Hoping to mask the sound of a snoring partner? I’ve tested all sorts of sleep tech and can point you toward the right gadget for your sleep goal.\nOne question to ask yourself is how well a device fits your lifestyle. If you want to monitor your trends, the Oura Ring and Whoop 4.0 have some of the most in-depth sleep and recovery tracking around. But these are devices with a singular focus. Busy folks might want something that’s also useful during the day. Smartwatches like the Pixel Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch 7, or Apple Watch will get you more utility for the price. On the other hand, there’s no point in wrist-based sleep trackers if you wake up in the middle of the night to take them off. If you can’t wear a watch, earbuds, or a ring to bed, you may want to look into non-invasive options like the Withings Sleep or the Google Nest Hub. And if you’re looking for earbuds to drown out noise, Anker’s Soundcore Sleep A20 buds are great for side sleepers and for folks who like to drift off to podcasts. Some more good news is three ex-Bose engineers have resurrected the Bose Sleepbuds — they’re Ozlo Sleepbuds now.\n\n\nPerformance\nA good sleep tech gadget doesn’t try to do too much at once. It ought to be excellent at addressing the main issue it’s trying to solve. The rest is gravy.\n\n\n\n\n\nValue \nSleep tech can be expensive. If you’re going to shell out, the gadget should make you think “Hell freakin’ yeah, this was totally worth it!”\n\n\n\n\n\nComfort\nYou can’t sleep well if you’re not comfy. Good sleep tech shouldn’t disturb your sleep. Is a tracker too bulky to be useful? Does a smart mattress cover feel lumpy?\n\n\n\n\n\nContext\nData is useless without context. If it’s a sleep tracker, how well does it present your sleep data? Will you learn anything valuable, or is it a mess of graphs that don’t make sense?\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery Life\nA sleep gadget that can’t last through the night ain’t that helpful. You should be confident the device can last a whole night without dying. If it’s also a fitness gadget or wearable, it should be able to either last all day between charges or support fast charging so it doesn’t run out midday.\n\n\nSleep tech has come a long way in just a few short years, but these aren’t medical devices, so take their sleep tracking data with a grain of salt. Gadgets like the Withings ScanWatch, Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 / Ultra, and Apple Watch Series 10 / Ultra 2 have FDA clearance for monitoring sleep disturbances. That doesn’t mean they can definitively diagnose you with sleep apnea. No matter how advanced the sensors are, or how many features a product may boast, trackers are meant to help spot when something’s off. Nothing more. \nTaking all that into consideration, I’ve compiled these recommendations based on how well a sleep gadget addresses the problems it’s trying to fix. We also considered comfort, accuracy, battery life, and whether it provides good context for its data.  \nThe best sleep tracker\nThe $349 Oura Ring 4 isn’t a fitness tracker that happens to track sleep. It’s a sleep tracker that happens to track some fitness metrics. The ring has seven temperature sensors, a green LED sensor for measuring heart rate, and red and infrared LEDs to measure blood oxygen. That’s not including the battery or accelerometers. \nAll these sensors provide a holistic look at your recovery. Each morning, you’re given a report on your readiness, sleep quality, and activity goals for the day. These reports tell you how your sleep impacts your daily ability to take on stress, and whether you should take it easy or challenge yourself. The app also includes wellness features like guided meditations and white noise to help you fall asleep. Oura recently released its fourth-gen model, and over the past year or so, it has released several new features, including cardiovascular age and capacity, an AI-powered chatbot advisor, daytime stress, and resilience. If you use the Natural Cycles app for digital birth control or fertility planning, it can be used in lieu of a basal body thermometer as well.\nOf all the sleep gadgets I’ve tested, the Oura Ring has the best context for its data, which it presents in an intuitive way. Its version of blood oxygen monitoring is also preferable to the random spot checks found on devices like the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7. Instead, the Oura Ring passively monitors your blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels during sleep and encourages you to check your baseline over a long period of time. It’s not exciting, but it’s a more useful measure for the average person. The Oura is also one of the few devices to include a recovery mode. If you’re sick or injured, you can hit pause on your activity goals until you’re back to full health.\nBut the main appeal here is the form factor: A ring is infinitely more comfortable than a watch. And although it’s not the most fashionable, it’s nondescript enough to wear to any event. Plus, you get up to a week on a single charge.  \nThe only thing I don’t love is that it now comes with a $6 monthly subscription. You can at least save a bit on the hardware if you opt for the last-gen Oura Ring while supplies last. However, if you’re truly passionate about monitoring your sleep and willing to commit long-term, it’s well worth the price.\nRead my review of the Oura Ring 4.\nThe best smartwatch with sleep tracking\nThe $349.99 Google Pixel Watch 3 has come a long way since the original Pixel Watch launched. For sleep tracking, the most important improvements since launch are better battery life and an automatic Bedtime Mode that detects when you’ve fallen asleep.\nOn the data side, the Pixel Watch also benefits from being a Fitbit smartwatch. Fitbit might be floundering a bit these days, but it was early to sleep tracking and it shows. Of course, you get sleep stages, but you can also view how your sleep compares to other people of your age and sex. Like the Oura Ring, it eschews SpO2 spot checks for passive overnight tracking (via the Estimated Oxygen Variation metric) and also provides a Daily Readiness Score based on your long-term activity and sleep quality. Since launch, Google also added nightly SpO2 percentages and Fitbit’s Sleep Profile feature to the Pixel Watch. After 14 days of sleep data in a month, the following month you’ll be assigned a cute sleep animal based on your sleep habits. The idea is to help you better understand your circadian rhythms and how it impacts sleep. Fitbit Premium subscribers also get access to a ton of wellness content, if that’s your thing. Apple and Samsung are still catching up here in terms of accuracy, battery life, and the level of detail in their sleep metrics.\nCompared to the Oura Ring, you’re going to get better exercise-tracking capabilities with the Pixel Watch’s built-in GPS. Although Oura has beefed up its exercise tracking, it’s still barebones. And the Pixel Watch is handier in day-to-day life because you can set silent alarms, use it for contactless payments, and receive notifications. It also supports Google Assistant.\nIf you’re a Samsung user, you might want to consider a combo of a Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or Galaxy Watch Ultra and the Galaxy Ring. Together, they let you mitigate the watch’s not-so-great battery and rely instead on the Ring to get your sleep data more comfortably. Admittedly, this is an expensive route. Samsung’s accuracy isn’t quite as good as Fitbit’s, but the company’s fleshed out its advanced sleep features. It, too, has a sleep profile feature that’s similar to Fitbit’s, though it arguably has a better selection of cartoon animals. (Samsung’s sleep coach said I was a cautious deer but spiritually, I identify as a nervous penguin.) Another point in Samsung’s favor? It’s been continually improving its sleep tracking. Galaxy Watch users can now view sleep stats in more detail from the wrist. The new software will also introduce a tweaked Sleep Mode, which utilizes the invisible infrared sensor for tracking instead of the visible green LED sensor. Earlier this year, Samsung also added FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection, but you’ll need a Samsung phone to use that feature.\nNeither of these two Android-only watches is an option for iPhone users, of course. If you refuse the green bubble life, the Apple Watch is the best smartwatch overall but its native sleep-tracking features have a long way to go. If you’re set on having an Apple Watch, they’ll get you the basics, plus FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection with the Series 10 and Ultra 2, and you can set sleep schedules that sync with your phone’s Focus modes. However, if you want great sleep tracking and are dead set on an Apple Watch, you’re better off downloading a third-party sleep app or getting one of the other options in this buying guide.\nRead my review of the Google Pixel Watch 3.\nThe best sleep tracker for athletes\nAs far as recovery goes, no sleep tech gadget goes the extra mile for athletes quite like Whoop. It primarily tracks your body’s ability to take on cardiovascular strain, but its take on sleep is unique. Instead of focusing on sleep quality, it zeroes in on your sleep debt and whether the sleep you’re getting is enough to fuel your training. \nIf you’re into scrutinizing how certain factors impact your sleep, Whoop is far ahead of the competition. You can log how anything from the COVID-19 vaccine to magnesium supplements affects your sleep. It’s not a necessary feature, but it’s a bonus if sleep journaling is important to you.\nUnlike with most modern wearables, you’ll get next to nothing in the way of notifications or smart features. However, that also means it’s got good battery life. The Whoop 4.0 also comes with a portable battery pack that slides onto the tracker itself. The result is you can go several days without ever having to take the tracker off. Whoop also gives you flexible options for wearing the device. For example, you can opt to wear it on your bicep, in your leggings, or even in a sports bra.\nThat said, this is a niche product best suited for athletes who engage in intensive cardio sports. (It’s not the best at tracking strain from activities like strength training.) The device costs nothing, but the $30 monthly subscription is steep. Whoop discounted its pricing for both annual and 24-month memberships in 2023, but if you’re a casual athlete, your money is still better spent elsewhere. But if you are someone who’s always training for an event or prone to overtraining, the Whoop 4.0 can get you that extra edge.\nIf this option is too pricey — or a minimum 12-month membership isn’t appealing — then you may want to consider a Garmin tracker or smartwatch. Like Whoop, you’ll get long battery life coupled with robust training features that factor in your sleep quality when determining your recovery. Garmin doesn’t have the best sleep stage accuracy, but the fitness insights make up for it. Especially if your real goal in improving sleep is to enhance athletic performance. There are dozens of Garmins to pick from, but if you’re on a budget, we really like the $179.99 Vivomove Sport or the $249.99 Venu Sq 2. The $449.99 Forerunner 265S is also another excellent midrange option for runners or triathletes.\nRead my review of the Whoop 4.0.\nThe best budget sleep tracker\nIf you don’t want to wear any gadgets to bed, the $129.95 Withings Sleep is a good, affordable option. It’s a long, rectangular mat with sensors and a fabric covering that you slip under your mattress. The sleep tracking was wonky when this product was first launched as the Nokia Sleep, but has since been improved. In addition to your heart rate and sleep cycles, it also tracks snoring and breathing disturbances. It’s also not battery-operated, so you don’t have to worry about charging the device every day.\nThe Withings Sleep is also one of the best options if you’re trying to suss out long-term sleeping patterns. Within the Withings app, you can generate an automatic, comprehensive sleep diary that helps break down important trends and visualize your metrics. That report can then be exported as a PDF that you share with your doctor.\nThe Withings Sleep isn’t particularly fancy, but it punches above its weight. While we’re bummed that Withings raised the price by $30 a couple of years ago, the Sleep is still often discounted during Black Friday and other shopping holidays. Withings also offers a bundle in case you need a second one for your sleep partner. \nRead my review of the Withings Sleep.\nThe best temperature-regulating sleep tech\nFor folks who run hot or cold, the Eight Sleep Pod 4 (starting at $2,649) is an effective — albeit ludicrously expensive — way to stop fighting over the blankets. The cover zips over your own mattress and comes with a water pump that regulates temperature on both sides of the bed. You can manually set your temperature schedules, or Eight Sleep has an autopilot function that adjusts the temperature of your bed for you. It plugs into an outlet, so there’s also no need to worry about battery life unless there’s a blackout. The new Pod 4 also gives you the option to go Ultra and add a new tech base for an extra $2,000. The base lets you change your bed’s elevation and slots directly into your existing bedframe.

Plus, you can set alarms, set audio to fade out after a certain period, or have it automatically shut off as you fall asleep. Battery life is also pretty good at around 14 hours.\nJust keep in mind that these don’t have active noise canceling. (Which is why they can last 14 hours.) They can passively dampen sound simply by sitting in your ear, but they’re not going to completely block out snoring or noisy neighbors unless you have media playing. The A10 buds are quite similar but have slightly less battery life at 10 hours.\nBut if you’d really rather the Bose Sleepbuds — good news! They’ve been resurrected as the Ozlo Sleepbuds and are virtually the same product in every way with one key improvement: you can now play your own audio! Sometime in early 2025, Ozlo says they intend to add sleep tracking as well. The downside is that at $299, they’re double the price of the Soundcore A20s.\nRead our review of the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20.\nUpdate, February 10th: Adjusted pricing and availability.","summary":"Sleep tech runs the gamut from trackers and apps to expensive smart beds, but it doesn’t all address the same issues.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23369207/apple-watch-se-2022-review-smartwatch\">second-gen Apple Watch SE</a>, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight alignnone\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-table-of-contents\"><ol><li><a href=\"#hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#Y5l6zo\">The best Apple Watch Series 9 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#6O6HRb\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#zdhvKu\">The best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals</a></li><li><a href=\"#MpVWgd\">A note on the more premium models</a></li></ol></div>\n</div>\n\n<p>But with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch\">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let’s get to the deals.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p>\n\n<p>While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Series 9</a>. That being said, it’s currently on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGJ5KQL7/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11385157008\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/2ck4subbff6o5\">Best Buy</a> right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which matches its all-time low. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHQ2QH6/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-42mm-Rose-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Light-Blush-Sport-Band-S-M/11381354322\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/psq78ximo6fzu\">Best Buy</a> starting at $359 (also $7o off), while the LTE models can be had at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGHTCKB1/\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-10-GPS-Cellular-46mm-Jet-Black-Aluminum-Case-with-Black-Sport-Band-M-L/11402806261\">Walmart</a>, and <a href=\"https://howl.link/im3gllg4s5nj9\">Best Buy</a> starting at $429 (about $20 off).</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"D9WbpN\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24246464/apple-watch-series-10-review-smartwatch-wearables\">Read our Apple Watch Series 10 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"Y5l6zo\">The best Apple Watch Series 9 deals</h2>\n\n<p>In 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen&nbsp;S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.</p>\n\n<p>The Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale in the 45mm configuration at <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-9-GPS-45mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-Sport-Band-M-L-Fitness-Tracker-ECG-Apps-Always-On-Retina-Display-Water-Resistant/5405516867\">Walmart</a> starting at $249 ($180 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the 41mm and LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.</p>\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"1D7GZC\"><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Read our Apple Watch Series 9 review</a>.</h5>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"6O6HRb\">The best Apple Watch SE deals</h2>\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23328608/apple-watch-se-new-second-gen-price-specs-features-release-date\">received a refresh in late 2022</a>. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n \n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nA note on the more premium models\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, it’s currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy right now in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which matches its all-time low. The 46mm variant, meanwhile, is on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $359 (also $7o off), while the LTE models can be had at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy starting at $429 (about $20 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.\nThe Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale in the 45mm configuration at Walmart starting at $249 ($180 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the 41mm and LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.\nRead our Apple Watch Series 9 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\nAt the moment, the best deals on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for around $169 ($80 off). The 44mm configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for around $199 (also $80 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 40mm configuration is currently on sale at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target starting at $219 ($80 off), or in the larger 44mm sizing at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target for around $249 ($80 off).\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations.

The device began shipping in February 2022, starting at $399.\nWith an unprecedented degree of support from Valve and the help of the gaming community, it progressed from being a “glorious mess” in our initial review to becoming one of The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2022 and something other companies couldn’t really match. More than two years after the Steam Deck launched, the landscape is very different now that new competition has arrived in the form of Windows-powered handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, and Ayaneo’s assorted decks.\nNow Valve’s new revision of the Steam Deck adds an OLED screen along with tons of other improvements that Sean Hollister says make it “everything the original should have been.”\n\nWe’ve been keeping a close eye on the Steam Deck and rivals, and you can read all of our coverage here.\nDamn, Polygon beat me to the Ayaneo 3.\n\t\t\t\nI plugged an Nvidia RTX

Ahead of the tariff going into effect, I wrote that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/605267/trump-tariffs-apple-google-microsoft-meta-nvidia-samsung\">“Big Tech has been silent on Trump’s tariffs</a>” —&nbsp;almost no one in the industry had a public reaction or said how they would respond. A week later, that hasn’t really changed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Myself and my colleagues have contacted a wide range of tech companies multiple times since the tariffs on China (and the now-paused tariffs <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/605119/trump-tariffs-mexico-pause-trade-negotiations\">on Canada and Mexico</a>) were announced at the beginning of the month. Here’s what we’ve heard back – or haven’t heard:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Google</strong> spokesperson Jose Castaneda, <strong>Microsoft</strong> spokesperson Kate Frischmann, <strong>Nvidia</strong> spokesperson Stephanie Matthew, and <strong>Sony</strong> spokesperson Kishore Sawh have declined to comment.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canon USA</strong>, via a generic press email address with no stated spokesperson, said that “Canon U.S.A., Inc. continues to monitor the situation regarding the tariffs.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DJI</strong>, also via a generic press email with no stated spokesperson, said that “we are assessing the impact internally and will be able to share more details once we complete the full evaluation and receive guidance from the USTR or other relevant departments.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Nintendo</strong>, and <strong>Samsung</strong> have not commented.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Other companies that haven&#8217;t commented include: Alibaba, AMD, AT&amp;T, Best Buy, Broadcom, Dell, EchoStar / Dish, Fujifilm, HP, Intel, Lenovo, LG, Logitech, Newegg, Nikon, Panasonic, Philips, Qualcomm, Shein, Target, TCL, Temu, Texas Instruments, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Walmart.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Just about every Big Tech company makes and ships products from China, so the tariff means higher costs to bring those products into the country. Those higher costs are often passed onto consumers, so if the tariff stays in effect, it seems likely that the companies will raise prices on their products or otherwise see their margins decline.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are a handful of reasons why companies may be hesitant to comment. It might take time for the companies to feel the effects of the tariff and know how it might impact their businesses. The Trump administration is chaotic, so companies may be waiting to see if the policy changes or gets put on pause, as it already has for Canada and Mexico. The administration is also vindictive, so the companies may not want to draw the ire of the president by blaming the tariffs for hurting their business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Automakers, on the other hand, have been more vocal.</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>BMW</strong>: “BMW does not base our long-term strategic plans on political policies or incentives,” BMW Group’s Phil DiIanni says in a statement. “Free trade, which has always been a guiding principle for the BMW Group, is of immense importance worldwide: It is one of the most crucial drivers of growth and progress. Tariffs, on the other hand, hinder free trade, slow down innovation, and set a negative spiral in motion.
