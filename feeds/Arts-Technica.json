What makes it intriguing is the way it's shot entirely from a Xenomorph's point of view as the creature races through a spaceship's corridor while a \"containment breached!\" warning repeats. The final shot said the spaceship is headed on a crash course toward Earth.\nThe official premise is short and sweet: \"When a mysterious space vessel crash-lands on Earth, a young woman (Sydney Chandler) and a ragtag group of tactical soldiers make a fateful discovery that puts them face-to-face with the planet’s greatest threat.\" We know very little yet about the specifics of the series other than that it is set two years before the events of the first film, Alien (1979).\nIt's promising that showrunner Noah Hawley has said that the style and mythology will be closer to that film, rather than Prometheus (2012) or Alien: Covenant, both of which were also prequels. “In the prequels, Ridley [Scott] made the technology thousands of years more advanced than the technology of Alien, which is supposed to take place in those movies’ future,\" he said last January. \"There’s something about that that doesn’t really compute for me. I prefer the retro-futurism of the first two films, and so that’s the choice I’ve made—there’s no holograms. The convenience of that beautiful Apple Store technology is not available to me.”\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/alien-earth-teaser-gives-us-xenomorphs-pov/#comments","content":"\n            The prequel series is set a couple of years before the events of the original 1979 film, <em>Alien</em>.\n          ","contentSnippet":"The prequel series is set a couple of years before the events of the original 1979 film, Alien.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/01/alien-earth-teaser-gives-us-xenomorphs-pov/","categories":["Culture","alien franchise","FX/Hulu","Hulu","Ridley Scott","streaming television","Trailers","TV trailers"],"isoDate":"2025-01-27T19:56:22.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","title":"Trump’s reported plans to save TikTok may violate SCOTUS-backed law","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-may-leave-tiktoks-algorithm-under-bytedances-control/","pubDate":"Mon, 27 Jan 2025 19:39:05 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was apparently a busy weekend for key players involved in Donald Trump's efforts to make a deal to save TikTok.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most appealing option for ByteDance could be if Trump blessed a merger between TikTok and Perplexity AI—a San Francisco-based AI search company worth about $9 billion that appears to view a TikTok video content acquisition as a path to compete with major players like Google and OpenAI.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday, Perplexity AI submitted a revised merger proposal to TikTok-owner ByteDance, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/26/perplexity-tiktok-revised-merger-proposal.html\">reviewed</a> by CNBC, which sources <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-trump-perplexity-87988733973760927bb5681f7de9b9af\">told AP News</a> included feedback from the Trump administration.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-may-leave-tiktoks-algorithm-under-bytedances-control/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-may-leave-tiktoks-algorithm-under-bytedances-control/#comments\">Comments</a></p>\n\n            ","content:encodedSnippet":"It was apparently a busy weekend for key players involved in Donald Trump's efforts to make a deal to save TikTok.\nPerhaps the most appealing option for ByteDance could be if Trump blessed a merger between TikTok and Perplexity AI—a San Francisco-based AI search company worth about $9 billion that appears to view a TikTok video content acquisition as a path to compete with major players like Google and OpenAI.\nOn Sunday, Perplexity AI submitted a revised merger proposal to TikTok-owner ByteDance, reviewed by CNBC, which sources told AP News included feedback from the Trump administration.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-may-leave-tiktoks-algorithm-under-bytedances-control/#comments","content":"\n            Everything insiders are saying about Trump’s plan to save TikTok.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Everything insiders are saying about Trump’s plan to save TikTok.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/trump-may-leave-tiktoks-algorithm-under-bytedances-control/","categories":["Policy","Artificial Intelligence","bytedance","Donald Trump","national security","oracle","Perplexity.ai","tiktok","TikTok ban"],"isoDate":"2025-01-27T19:39:05.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Scharon Harding\n        ","title":"A long, costly road ahead for customers abandoning Broadcom’s VMware","link":"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/01/a-long-costly-road-ahead-for-customers-abandoning-broadcoms-vmware/","pubDate":"Mon, 27 Jan 2025 18:36:31 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Broadcom's ownership of VMware has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/a-year-after-broadcoms-vmware-buy-customers-eye-exit-strategies/\">discouraged many of its customers</a>, as companies are displeased with how the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/as-firms-abandon-vmware-broadcom-is-laughing-all-the-way-to-the-bank/\">trillion-dollar firm</a> has run the virtualization business since buying it in November 2023.
