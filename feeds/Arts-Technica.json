The researchers behind the new work find indications that there's a significant population of rocky super-Earths that are traveling in orbits similar to that of Jupiter and Saturn.\nLenses go micro\nThe two primary methods we've used to discover exoplanets are called transit and radial velocity. In the transit method, we simply watch the star for dips in the light it sends to Earth, which can be an indication of a planet orbiting in a way that it eclipses a small fraction of the star. For radial velocity, we look for red- or blue-shifts in the light received from the star, caused by a planet tugging the star in different directions as it orbits.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          John Timmer\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/new-study-there-are-lots-of-icy-super-earths/#comments","content":"\n            \"Microlensing\" lets us find planets at much greater distances from their star.\n          ","contentSnippet":"\"Microlensing\" lets us find planets at much greater distances from their star.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/new-study-there-are-lots-of-icy-super-earths/","categories":["Science","astronomy","exoplanets","microlensing"],"isoDate":"2025-04-25T21:06:25.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Samuel Axon\n        ","title":"Netflix introduces a new kind of subtitles for the non-hearing impaired","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/cant-understand-dialogue-on-tv-shows-netflix-has-a-new-feature-for-you/","pubDate":"Fri, 25 Apr 2025 20:48:44 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Multiple studies and investigations have found that about half of American households watch TV and movies with subtitles on, but only a relatively small portion of those include someone with a hearing disability.
