But whales and other marine mammals like seals also help in this regard by releasing tons of nutrient-rich fecal matter into those waters. Now we can add whale urine to that list, according to a paper published in the journal Nature Communications.\n“Lots of people think of plants as the lungs of the planet, taking in carbon dioxide, and expelling oxygen,” said co-author Joe Roman, a biologist at the University of Vermont. “For their part, animals play an important role in moving nutrients. Seabirds transport nitrogen and phosphorus from the ocean to the land in their poop, increasing the density of plants on islands. Animals form the circulatory system of the planet—and whales are the extreme example.”\nBack in 2010, Roman co-authored a study in which they examined field measurements and population data to determine that whales and seals could be responsible for replenishing 2.3×104 metric tons of nitrogen per year in the Gulf of Maine alone. Specifically, they feed in deeper waters and then release \"flocculent fecal plumes\" (i.e., feces) at the surface, serving as a kind of \"whale pump\" that boosts plankton growth, among other tangible benefits.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Jennifer Ouellette\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-whale-urine-benefits-the-ocean-ecosystem/#comments","content":"\n            Great whales can transport 4,000 tons of nitrogen annually to tropical coastal areas.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Great whales can transport 4,000 tons of nitrogen annually to tropical coastal areas.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/how-whale-urine-benefits-the-ocean-ecosystem/","categories":["Science","Biology","Ecology","marine animals","marine ecology","whales"],"isoDate":"2025-03-11T19:49:46.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Beth Mole\n        ","title":"Texas measles outbreak spills into third state as cases reach 258","link":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-spills-into-third-state-as-cases-reach-258/","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 19:29:03 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Two people in Oklahoma have likely contracted measles infections linked to a mushrooming outbreak that began in West Texas, which has now risen to at least 258 cases since late January.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://oklahoma.gov/health/news---events/newsroom/2025/first-cases-of-measles-in-oklahoma-reported.html\">Oklahoma's health department reported</a> that two people had \"exposure associated with the Texas and New Mexico outbreak\" and then reported symptoms consistent with measles.

At least one expert told Ars that their fear isn't completely unfounded.\nSigned into law by Joe Biden in 2022, the CHIPS Act sought to grant $52.7 billion in subsidies to bring the most advanced chipmakers into the US. The Commerce Department has already signed contracts granting a wide range of awards, including grants for chipmakers like Intel, Micron, Samsung, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), totaling more than $36 billion in federal subsidies.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Ashley Belanger\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/how-trump-could-potentially-claw-back-chips-funding/#comments","content":"\n            Chipmakers fear Trump may rescind CHIPS Act funding, report says.\n          ","contentSnippet":"Chipmakers fear Trump may rescind CHIPS Act funding, report says.","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/03/how-trump-could-potentially-claw-back-chips-funding/","categories":["Policy","Chips Act","chips and science act"],"isoDate":"2025-03-11T16:00:27.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Beth Mole\n        ","title":"This is what it looks like when parasitic worms directly invade your brain","link":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-parasitic-worms-directly-invade-your-brain/","pubDate":"Tue, 11 Mar 2025 15:14:04 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>Doctors in China inadvertently took time-series images of parasitic worms actively invading a woman's brain and causing rare and rapidly progressing lesions.</p>\n<p>The previously healthy 60-year-old woman went to the hospital after having a fever and altered mental status for three days, according to a report of her case <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2831148\">published Monday in JAMA Neurology</a>.
