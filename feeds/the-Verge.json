The latest update, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253366/watch-os-11-apple-watch-smartwatch\">watchOS 11</a>, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.</p>\n<p id=\"C0aQBE\">That being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.</p>\n<p id=\"M0L8KW\">Now, let’s get to the deals.</p>\n<div><aside id=\"0Qe5br\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to choose which Apple Watch to buy\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23037217/best-apple-watch-series-se-ultra\"},{\"title\":\"The best AirPods deals available right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals\"},{\"title\":\"Here are the best iPad deals right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<h2 id=\"hZHCRf\">The best Apple Watch Series 10 deals</h2>\n<div id=\"kuzcBW\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12429524\"></div></div>\n<div id=\"rOw2iI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:12462708\"></div></div>\n<p id=\"KCUrjH\">The Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"rPKDmW\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Apple Watch sleep apnea detection gets FDA clearance\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/16/24246150/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-fda-approval\"},{\"title\":\"The Apple Watch is now a better TV remote\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249074/apple-watch-watchos-11-tv-remote\"},{\"title\":\"Here’s how the new Apple Watch Series 10 stacks up to other models\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/24240412/apple-watch-series-10-vs-ultra-2-se-comparison-specs-price\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"PS4qua\">While the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23878981/apple-watch-series-9-ultra-2-review-double-tap-precision-finding-siri\">Series 9</a>.

It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.</p>\n<div class=\"c-float-left c-float-hang\"><aside id=\"eSbn28\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to customize double tap on the Apple Watch\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23930197/double-tap-apple-watch-how-to-use\"},{\"title\":\"The best MagSafe and Qi2 chargers for your iPhone\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/23505846/best-magsafe-magnetic-chargers-apple-iphone\"},{\"title\":\"The Apple Watch made smartwatches the wearable of choice\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/8/24237890/apple-watch-10-years-smartwatch-wearables\"}]}'></div></aside></div>\n<p id=\"eN7K4x\">The Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch.

Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after.

Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n\n\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\n\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\n\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, you can already pick it up at Amazon and Best Buy in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which matches the wearable's best price to date. The GPS-equipped model is also on sale at Amazon and Best Buy in the 46mm variant for $359 ($70 off), while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $429 ($70 off).\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\n\n\n\n\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.\n\n\nThe Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale in the 45mm configuration at Walmart starting at $279 ($150 off), or at Amazon and Best Buy in the 41mm sizing starting at $299 ($100 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the LTE-equipped Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.\nRead our Apple Watch Series 9 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n\n\n\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\n\n\nAt the moment, the best deals on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $199 ($50 off). The 44mm configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $229 ($50 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 40mm configuration is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $249 ($50 off), or in the larger 44mm sizing at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $279 ($50 off), its typical sale price.\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\n\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\n\n\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with a Trail Loop starting at $719.99 (about $79 off), or with an Alpine Loop at Amazon starting at $759 ($40 off). You can also pick it up at Amazon with an Ocean Band starting at $769 ($30 off), which is about $80 more than the lowest price we’ve seen on the elastomer-equipped model.\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium.
