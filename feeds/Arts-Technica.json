Even with that advantage, though, a successful God Run 3 completion took Nico 120 days of real-time effort due to frequent restarts whenever he took a single hit.\nThis time around, Nico cranked up the difficulty even further by deciding not to level his characters even once (though he was able to increase his stats and abilities in some games with level 1-accessible items and weapons). After his first level 1 God Run attempt two months ago, Nico's efforts culminated in a roughly 11-hour multi-day marathon run over the weekend, which saw Nico break down in tears at the end of the ordeal.\nRead full article\nComments","dc:creator":"\n          Kyle Orland\n        ","comments":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-god-run-dark-souls-player-beats-seven-games-at-level-1-without-taking-a-hit/#comments","content":"\n            So, what's your excuse?\n          ","contentSnippet":"So, what's your excuse?","guid":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-god-run-dark-souls-player-beats-seven-games-at-level-1-without-taking-a-hit/","categories":["Gaming"],"isoDate":"2025-02-18T21:23:08.000Z"},{"creator":"\n          Andrew Cunningham\n        ","title":"Acer CEO says its PC prices to increase by 10 percent in response to Trump tariffs","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/acer-ceo-says-its-pc-prices-to-increase-by-10-percent-in-response-to-trump-tariffs/","pubDate":"Tue, 18 Feb 2025 21:14:16 +0000","content:encoded":"\n              <p>PC-manufacturer Acer has said that it plans to raise the prices of its PCs in the US by 10 percent, a direct response to the new 10 percent import tariff on Chinese goods that the Trump administration <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/tariffs-on-biggest-us-trading-partners-likely-to-spike-cost-of-cars-tech/\">announced earlier this month</a>.</p>\n<p>\"We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff,\" said Acer CEO Jason Chen in <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/02/16/computer-giant-to-raise-prices-by-10pc-in-response-to-trump/\">an interview with The Telegraph</a>. \"We think 10 percent probably will be the default price increase because of the import tax.

Looking at this thing, you might expect to see it propped up at an airport bar, in front of somebody talking into wireless headphones about Tim in Product. But there’s a lot of frame-rendering and multicore processing power inside this glass-fronted slab with a keyboard cover. It's an impressive showcase for AMD's leap forward in integrated power.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The Z13 can rip through <i>Hitman</i> and <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i> on their highest settings at its native 2560×1600 resolution. Turn the resolution down to a reasonable-for-this-size 1920×1080 and you can play <i>Cyberpunk 2077 </i>at its Ultra settings at 45–55 frames per second, depending on your power and upscaling preferences. On a device that is essentially a beefy Microsoft Surface, this is no small thing.

But there’s a lot of frame-rendering and multicore processing power inside this glass-fronted slab with a keyboard cover. It's an impressive showcase for AMD's leap forward in integrated power.\nThe Z13 can rip through Hitman and Shadow of the Tomb Raider on their highest settings at its native 2560×1600 resolution.
